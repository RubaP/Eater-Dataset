 <START:Food> really good <END>   <START:Food> stuff <END> !! The  <START:F_Dessert> custard <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> ! I loved  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and when I am back  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the old USA I can only hope I will cross paths with another culvers.You know what the thing is with culvers? You actually don't need  <START:Food> that <END>  much,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's sort of like eating  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END>  or  <START:F_Appetizer> cookie <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> dough <END> . You can only have so much before you start getting  <START:Food> that <END>  sickly feeling and start stirring  <START:Food> that <END>  plastic  <START:Food> spoon <END>  around and staring down the  <START:F_Dessert> custard <END>  and wondering why you dont wanna finish. Yeah  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:F_Dessert> custard <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's heavy especially when you add every kind of peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> chocholate <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to the mix.Let me tell you those first five spoonfuls are pure goodness then  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  goes downhill. Less is more with this  <START:Food> stuff <END>  let me tell you! Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I am getting the smallest  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END> , and I will be far more pleased and not guilty I threw out a mega  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>   <START:Food> bucket <END> . Hahaha!
Mr. Roberts is not a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I'd ever go to for the sole purpose of going out. Both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  I've gone have been for  <START:A_Ent_Music> bands <END> , and both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  were fairly different  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END> .My first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  was a one- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> :  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was ridiculously hot and humid inside, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  lacked any sort of motivation for good customer  <START:Service> service <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  crammed the 7- or 8-piece  <START:A_Ent_Music> band <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the front of the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  near the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END> , making for awkward  <START:A_OutsideView> viewing <END>  and playing. The  <START:A_Ent_Music> sound <END>  was terrible and I spent more  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  than  <START:Restaurant> in <END> . My second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  was a better  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , but still not one  <START:Food> that <END>  would cause me to suggest other  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  go  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . This  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  around  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a reasonable  <START:A_Env_Type> temperature <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , but  <START:Food> that <END>  may only be due to the fact  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the 50s  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> . The  <START:A_Ent_Music> bands <END>  played  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the back of the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  an alcove/side  <START:A_Places> room <END>  deal and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  made a lot more sense. The  <START:A_Ent_Music> sound <END>  was still deafening and subject to random strangers twiddling the knobs on the mixer, but overall not too bad.  <START:Offers> free <END>   <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  is the best thing (only thing?) Mr. Roberts has going for  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  biggest downsides:-  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's touted as a blue-collar  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's more an excuse to be shabby and dirty than  <START:Food> anything <END> ; $ <START:O_Pay_Price> 15 <END>  for a  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END> -bottle  <START:Food> bucket <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  is not a good deal, and $ <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>  for a PBR & a rail shot is a special for a couple hours one night a week when  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  should be the standard  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  for such a combination- the ladies  <START:A_Places> room <END>  is ridiculously tiny and awkward, had a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  was half hanging off the bowl, and no TP- every  <START:A_Environment> surface <END>  was dirty or sticky, yuckYou probably won't die if you go to see a friend's  <START:A_Ent_Music> band <END>  play, but supporting a friend should be the only motivation for setting foot inside.
I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a handful of  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  over the years for dinner.  Had no clue  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had a weekend brunch  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  I think I was the only one  <START:Food> that <END>    <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  off the regular  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  our group.  Based on comments  <START:S_Staff> no one <END>  went away unhappy with their  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> .  Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  had never worked opening shift before but did a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Service> job <END> .  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is getting a little worn but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  fits.  I am sure I'll end up  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again.
NO NO NO, this  <START:Restaurant> placemakes <END>  Panda Express seem gourmet. Garbage  <START:Food> food <END> !
I have been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  twice on a whim. The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I ate my  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty decent. The second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , I placed an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to go and unfortunately I should have checked  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  before I left. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was dripping  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> . Not sure what  <START:Food> that <END>  was all about but I was so disappointed. Did I eat any of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , yes because I was hungry however  <START:Food> that <END>  was a mistake as I felt sick to my stomach later  <START:Food> that <END>  day. I will give the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  another try  one day as maybe the cook was having an off morning. Like I said before, when I ate at the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ,  the  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent, but take out, make sure you check  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  before you leave so  <START:Food> that <END>  you don't end up with a box of  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> . Blech
My  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  at this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was probably one of the worst I've ever had. My friends and I went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for a Suns  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  at a  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  near the  <START:A_Furniture> door <END> . As we were sitting  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , a girl who was  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , looked above our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and saw a cockroach crawling right over our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . Now granted, I have a phobia of bugs, and especially roaches, but this seems to me, like a pretty big deal. After the initial scare, I informed our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  of this and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  freaked out for a second, and ran off to tell someone.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  didnt return for another  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> , though  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was only to bring  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . I then told the  <START:S_Staff> host <END>  near the  <START:A_Furniture> door <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  exclaimed  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was horrible and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  walked away(apparently to get someone?). After another 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  still nothing happened so I found the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  again and told him nothing has been done yet. By this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , the others at my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  had gotten their  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  told me  <START:Food> that <END>  since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was so high on the ceiling  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no way for him to get to  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . Now, I'm no engineer, or trained exterminator, but I had about 2-3 different ideas on how to get to the roach. I didnt realize  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was stumped. I felt like I should make a bigger deal about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , but instead I left. I don't feel like anyone should be forced to eat  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  those conditions, without at least an attempt to rectify  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . I mean, I dont have any delusions about spic and span  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> . I know  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  are dirty, but to have a roach hanging over our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  is unacceptable. And the only reason the  <START:S_Staff> management <END>  would do nothing is because  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would have made a scene. I guarantee you if  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  else  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  had seen  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  or was  <START:O_Experience> experiencing <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> , SOMETHING would have been done. For us to have to endure  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  because no else was being affected is basically saying we dont matter enough for  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  to do  <START:Food> anything <END> . How was the  <START:Food> food <END>  you ask? I didnt even see  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  since I was focusing on the large roach hanging over my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .
Amazing  <START:Service> service <END>  from Jelly for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  today, and seriously good  <START:Food> food <END> !  A wonderful hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  with heat and a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pico <END>  start things before you even get to sample the tasty  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END> .  Highly recommended.
My co-worker and I literally didn't know what we wanted for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and were just about to put names of  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  to draw...but when we wrote down TGIF...well... <START:Food> lunch <END>  fell into  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for us! Lol! So when we got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had a banner  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  advertising a  <START:Offers> 2 for 10.99 <END>  on a half rack of BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> ...i made my mind up before I walked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_Furniture> door <END> !  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  actually give you a separate sheet of paper for their  <START:Offers> 2 for 10.99 <END>   <START:Offers> offers <END>  so I guess you HAVE to ask  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  or you'll never even know  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  exists! I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  my  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> garlic <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> tomato <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> basil <END> (?)  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> ) and my  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> ...DeEELiCiOuS!!!  <START:Food> that <END>  Jack Daniels BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is something else! The  <START:Food> entree <END>  comes with  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and cole  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END> ...I asked if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  could replace  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with a  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  pilaf or something but  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Offers> 2 for 10.99 <END>  won't allow  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  I guess :( ...but the  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END>  was surprising okay!  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has green  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cilantro <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> ...kinda reminded me of the inside of a  <START:F_FoodItem>   fish     taco   <END>  minus the  <START:F_Ingredients> fish <END> ! Lol! We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a whiskey caramel  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  a la mode...idk what  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's called....but  <START:Food> that <END>  was TO DIE FOR!!! decadent and not super sweet perfect blend of flavors!  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  way to end the  <START:Food> meal <END> !...AND...you get $2 off  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>  at  <START:Food> lunch <END> ! :) I love a  <START:Offers> discount <END> !The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was awesome! Super attentive...definitely will go back for more! :)
Always wanted to stop by, just never did till today. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is much larger on the inside then  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looks. The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is impressive and not over the top. Two full  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> pool <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and plenty of  <START:A_Places> room <END>  for  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  to relax while you play. Two digital dart  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>  as well.I was disappointed  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the fact  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  don't have a  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  so no  <START:Food> food <END> , but the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  stated  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  may be getting  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back soon, so I will definately  <START:O_Experience> be back <END>  to check  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out again.
As other reviewers stated,  <START:Service> service <END>  is spotty (polite, but mostly absent, which is strange  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  this  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END> ).   <START:Food> food <END>  is good:  <START:F_FoodItem> omelets <END>  are LARGE - clearly can be split by 2 regular  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  folks.  Well prepared and full of good  <START:Food> stuff <END> .  Our sides of the banana  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and pumpkin  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  were clearly warmed over which was a little embarrassing for the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  (who danced around the subject)  But the  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  course, which was the reason for visiting, hit the mark.Not easy to get  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  and out of since you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  at the register ( <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  during our visit turned into a 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  ordeal -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  happens).  But, as Yelp says, A-OK.
My favorite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  EVER! I no  <START:W_Waiting> longer <END>  live  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Madison but every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I visit, I make sure  <START:Food> that <END>  I stop  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  is too-di- for, the  <START:Service> service <END>  is always friendly and-- espeicially after their remodel  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the last year--the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is classy but casual. I really can't say enough goo things about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , you won't regret  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !
I have been going to this  <START:Restaurant> deli <END>  for many years.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has changed  <START:A_LocatedArea> locations <END>  and chaged  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  but  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  never lost  <START:Food> anything <END>  along the way. I would say  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  got better as the years have gone on. By far the best  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END>  baked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  house everyday. Every party or  get-together i have or go to I will always stop  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and grad some  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have Boars Head  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  which is the best  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  Italian sausage  <START:Food> that <END>  comes  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  from Chicago.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  specials.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have take home  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  kits.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  include the  <START:F_Ingredients> dough <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , and  <START:F_Ingredients> peperoni <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are good! Check this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  out if your  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  is  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  going out of your way to get.
Fantastic thin  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  with the best  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  cooked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a coal fired oven.  <START:Service> service <END>  was friendly and efficient. Highly recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I kind of stuffed myself full of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  slices- but hey I rarely get  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  so this was my  <START:Service> treat <END>  and I won't be ashamed of myself f I break my scale tomorrow ah!
I went  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> .   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were a step above del  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were still ok.  Not 9 bucks ok, but ok.My  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  was never empty, and my  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> (es) were very nice. <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was slow and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:A_Env_AC> cold <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> , I felt sorry for  <START:S_Staff> them <END> .Also, the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  drowned out the bible thumping street preacher screaming  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> .  I wanted to invite him  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  for a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and to tempt himself to think of the sins of the flesh.  Poor  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  looked like  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  could use  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  Wound up  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  all  <START:Food> that <END>  rage... when  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and women 10 feet away.
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a total  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Dive!  I dig; this is my  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> !   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's generally pretty quiet and I can actually hear what you're saying.  I enjoy getting small  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  along with my  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .  Reverse every Friday - Sunday!  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is pretty good - I wouldn't say  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's the best but edible.   <START:Service> service <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  -  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is always friendly and down to earth.  The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is pretty cool - modern Japanese style.  This is my "No Significant Other"  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  - yes so if you're hanging with me and we're going to Crazy  <START:F_Ingredients> fish <END>  you best not bring your partner - you'll get slapped!  Haha - really!  - Enjoy!
THE BEST Mongolian  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  anywhere! Yum!
Amazing since the late nineties. Still is  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  2013.
Absolute worse. I would never stay  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again. Went on vacation with a friend  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was piss poor, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was all over the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and when we first got to our  <START:A_Places> room <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  still had filth  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> . We received no basic amenities and received all around bad  <START:Service> service <END>  with this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Never again!
I am utterly addicted to their  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  is fantastic, and the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  are very polite and professional. I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to death.
Ok, if you have no other options. I work graveyard, and this is one of the only  <START:Restaurant> places <END>   <START:Food> that <END>   <START:S_Delivery> delivers <END>  near me overnight.  Their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is ok, NY style.  But, aside from their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , I'd advise to stay away.  I don't think  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a single  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  anywhere to be found.  <START:Food> that <END>  includes their  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> .    <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not too hard to throw a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  breast on a flat grill, but this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  insists on using pre-cooked  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  on  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:Food> items <END> .. And you can really tell.   All of their  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  are frozen, and fried.If this is your last ditch resort, then go ahead.. But if you have other options, exercise  <START:S_Staff> them <END> !
This review is just about the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , not the  <START:Service> service <END>  or  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , as I have only  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  delivery from this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  just isn't  <START:Food> that <END>  good.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have some  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END>  combinations  <START:Food> that <END>  are interesting, but I've found  <START:Food> that <END>  most of  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  just miss the mark.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  end up being  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>  heavy or  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END>  heavy without much  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  or balance. Their  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  are primarily watery iceberg  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  with a few  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  thrown  <START:Restaurant> in <END> . Their  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  dressings are bagged and uninspired. I agree  <START:Food> that <END>  the Mediterranean  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is their best, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  probably the only thing I would eat if I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again.
Ok, so is this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  1- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  or  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END> ?¿?  Stopped  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  today just after 11 AM for a first visit, to find out.  The first thing I noticed was all the $100k+ cars  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot!  Somehow  <START:Food> that <END>  didn't seem to go with an old Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> !  The next surprise was  <START:Food> that <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was already getting busy!   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  DO have a loyal, moneyed clientele, for whatever reason!Ok, so I stepped inside.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's an oddball  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Places> room <END>  as well as a regular dining  <START:A_Places> room <END>  and an  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> .  The whole  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  struck me as pretty boozy, but credit  <START:Food> that <END>  at least  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  part due to the fact  <START:Food> that <END>  all of the other customers seemed to be having  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  (for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> ?).  Uck.  So anyway, I ate  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the regular dining  <START:A_Places> room <END> , within which I wasn't completely comfortable.  I'm picky about  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  &  <START:A_Decor> lighting <END>  & I just didn't end up with a  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  I liked.The  <START:Food> food <END> :  Shortly after I was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> , a big bowl of  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  & a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of fairly hot chunky style  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  arrived.  Both were delicious, & a second  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  was cheerfully provided.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a 2-Item Combo, with a Nana's [Chile] Relleno and a Machaca (shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> , hard shell)  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END> .Before long my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  landed on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , attractively placed on a piping hot platter.  The Relleno was unusual  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't  <START:F_FoodItem> breaded <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a medium  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END> , medium hot Pablano, stuffed with Oaxaca  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  & topped with a little Ranchero or Cotija.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was good.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  was big, tasty, & had a good amount of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .  Both the refried  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  & the Spanish  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  were super good, &  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a bed of shredded  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  to mop up the platter with.For me, this was a 4- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Service> served <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  2- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  comfort.  The  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  was near the high end at $ <START:O_Pay_Price> 10.50 <END> , but the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:A_Places> portions <END>  were excellent and so was the  <START:Service> service <END> .     :-)
Are we even talking about this?!?! This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  blows my mind every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . Those  <START:F_Ingredients> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>  are a steal at twice the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> . For a truly incomparable  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for dinner.
Walked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  on a sunday night without  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and had an AWESOME  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> !  ( we we're not  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  but sitting right at a huge open  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>  with a mostly unobstructed  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  of the bellagio fountains)the  <START:Service> service <END>  was awesome - the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> , always had a smile and always realllly attentive, I loved  <START:Food> that <END> !The  <START:Food> food <END>  :  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a mere " Meh!"  Although, i would like to come back and try something else. I had a New York  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END>  - didnt really like the crispy  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were  <START:Service> served <END>  with, the macaronni  <START:F_FoodItem> gratin <END>  was way too rich, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like a shoe!! I think theses  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  rely too much on their "  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> " and dont really give much thought to the actual   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> .Thankfully, i ate almost a whole  <START:F_Appetizer> baghette <END>  before the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  came so i was satisfied!! lol. Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I visit this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  will be for   <START:Food> lunch <END>  , and ill try a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwhich <END> . 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for the  <START:Service> service <END> , the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END> ! definitely will be coming back...
Our last  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Vegas and we came  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . We sat on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> in <END>  January!) and had the best  <START:Food> meal <END>  we've had  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>  days we were  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Perfectly cooked filet  <START:F_Ingredients> mignon <END>  with Merlot  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  and good little French " <START:F_FoodItem> frites <END> ".  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  gluten  <START:Offers> free <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , a gluten  <START:Offers> free <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> , and special  <START:F_FI_Healthy> allergy <END>  tags for  <START:Food> food <END> .
Hubby and I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  eye,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , and their version of mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was so delicious as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was bursting with wonderful  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  The shiitake  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  were amazing!  The mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  was just ok.  I initially  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  of white  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , but decided a few sips later  <START:Food> that <END>  I needed a  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  of Pinot Noir to pair with my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  instead.  Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  gladly obliged with my request.  I wish I can dock off half a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  because of the  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  take of you at your  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .  A lady with a camera came to us and asked if we wanted a  <START:A_Decor> picture <END> .  Thinking  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be like Morton's, a complimentary  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>  of us  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a little cardboard  <START:S_Gift> frame <END>  folder.  The lady came back out with a  <START:A_Furniture> leather <END>   <START:S_Gift> frame <END>  folder, about 11x13" or so, with two of our  <START:A_Decor> pictures <END>  enclosed.  Granted, we didn't like how we looked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:S_Staff> them <END> , then  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  threw the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  at us of $60.  Heck no!  I'm not  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  much for dinner  <START:A_Decor> pictures <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  we don't even like.  We're not obligated to buy  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  made me feel bad because the poor lady went through all  <START:Food> that <END> .
I went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  yesterday for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with friends. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good, as usual (I had  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> parmesan <END>  and my fiance had an alfredo  <START:Food> dish <END> , which  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said wasn't  <START:Food> that <END>  good) but this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  the  <START:Service> service <END>  wasn't as superb. My fiance's silverware was dirty, and my Pepsi  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  flat. I ended up just drinking  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . Our initial  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  mysteriously disappeared after getting our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> ... another  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  took over and said  <START:Food> that <END>  the other  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  had to "take off." This was kind of confusing, because we saw  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:S_Staff> waitressing <END>  other  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  right by us. Plus, I never like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  when  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are about  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>  different  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  stopping by your  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . One  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  asked if we wanted more  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , and we said yes, and then  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  never brought the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  basket back. Different  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  brought out our  <START:Food> dishes <END> ... and, nearing the end our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  kept asking us if we needed  <START:Food> anything <END>  (we were just sitting  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  talking), which made us feel like  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  wanted us to leave. I think we would have understood this had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  been extremely busy and a long  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was hardly anyone  <START:Restaurant> there <END> !
I used to hate Carly's.  I couldn't see the appeal.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  is always abysmally slow.  The seasonal tap is always empty - half the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  don't even know what  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is supposed to be filled with.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is... okay.  A few of the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are  <START:Food> really good <END> , but the  <START:Food> vegetarian <END>  and vegan options are pretty  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>  - when I started eating  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  again, I started liking the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a lot more.The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has grown on me the past couple years, though.   <START:Restaurant> they <END> 've started hiring some pretty good  <START:A_Ent_Music> musicians <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  has been stepped up a little bit.  Unlike the Lost Leaf or Roosevelt, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is big enough to accommodate a  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  without making conversation impossible.I guess I now feel  <START:Food> that <END>  Carly's is A-OK.  Accept the fact  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  aren't trying particularly hard, and you'll be able to enjoy the convenience and relatively low  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  all.
Best spot  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the house,  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  AND  <START:Restaurant> shops <END> / <START:A_Decor> themed <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> . Problem was the  <START:Food> food <END>  was quite aweful. French  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , the filet  <START:F_FoodItem> migon <END>  and even  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  was bad. The only had one seasoning, lots and lots and lots of  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> .
What a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> ! Definitely coming back & bringing friends next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . Between the constant  <START:Service> service <END> , deliciously full flavored  <START:Food> meals <END>  & the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> ... <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has officially ranked on to my Top 10 List!
Amazing and a top of must do list  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Vegas!Reserve for a half our before sunset and enjoy the ride... Much better than the High Roller.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  accommodated our group of 8 with special birthday requests and beyond. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the tasting  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was superb! Seared  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and Fillet  2 inches thick, medium rare and perfect.  <START:Service> service <END>  was spot on and the  <START:A_OutsideView> exterior <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> entertainment <END>  was steady.  We will eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on our next visit.
 <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  was good, prompt and friendly. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:Offers> offers <END>  your typical American  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  fare at a  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  which is average for Vegas but more expensive  <START:Food> that <END>  anywhere else  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the USA. We had the  <START:F_Ingredients> corned <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  hash with poached  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> . Nice. However  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  over from us had to send their  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  back because  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was gristly.I was tossing up to give this 3  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . But the  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  thing  <START:Food> that <END>  let  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  down was the $ <START:O_Pay_Price> 3.75 <END>  charge for brewed  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> .  The  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  was just terrible and I resented  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  at any  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> .
OK so I am a picky eater who tends to lean towards  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  While  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Vegas for the weekend, my BF and I decided to try Nove Italiano mainly bc we wanted a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with a nice  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and a nice  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> .We figured, "OK Italian,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  will probably be pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary"Were we wrong.This  <START:Food> food <END>  was unbelievable. <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the beginning  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  bring you an assortment of  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> breads <END>  and breadsticks with a little tray on the side with  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>  Oil, Red  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  Flakes and  <START:F_FoodItem> parmesan <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  for dipping. I dont usually partake  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , but I did try a thin  <START:F_Ingredients> breadstick <END>  with the dippings and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:Food> really good <END> .After reading about the Grilled Octopus App on yelp, I figured we had to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   Let me tell you,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was amazing.   Obviously not for  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  bc  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  octopus, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was so tender and the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> marinade <END>  was simple but very very  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  and a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were grilled so  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were crispy.  Like nothing I have ever had before.The  <START:F_FoodItem> marinade <END>  was not too heavy, more like a ton of  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> herbs <END> .I had the White  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> clams <END> .Very simple but amazing.Extremely thin  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>  so you can eat  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and not feel full or guilty.  And big  <START:F_FoodItem> clams <END>  and plenty of  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  on top.My BF got the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Marsala.    <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was on the bone which at first seemed weird, but  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  loved  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  bc  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  fell off the bone.Huge gourmet  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  and plenty of  <START:S_Staff> them <END> .On the side  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  had penne  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Alfredo  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  which  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  loved.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looked like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END> -made  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and a bit lighter then what you would expect alfredo to be.We got a side of the Aparagus special  <START:Food> dish <END> , which was Grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END>  with an  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  and Ricotta  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .Sounds totally weird, I know, but so  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> !!The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is also swanky and upscale but comfortable, the  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .Overall this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a Must when  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Vegas.And the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  ,we thought, was very fair.  We more than enough  <START:Food> food <END> , and 1  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and a Diet  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END>  and the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  was $125 with  <START:O_Payment> tip <END> .     Not bad at all for a fine  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Vegas.
Ok,  <START:Food> buffet <END>  but not outstanding.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was easy  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  and easy out, but the  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  seemes somewhat limited.  My wife did not like the freshness or the the seasoning of the   <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  Probably a good  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  with coupon for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  or  <START:Food> lunch <END> , but you can do better.
The only thing worse than their mediocre  <START:Food> food <END>  turns out to be their completely rude and condescending  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . I have given Ken's more business than  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  ever deserved over the past couple of years solely due to  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  proximity to home and work. The  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  I had  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  last weekend will certainly be my last.  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the past I had  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  things which didn't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:Food> that <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END> , one particular  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  Uni (sea urchin), a favorite of mine. I will forego any comparisons  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  for the sake of the weary, but let's just say  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was horrible. So, I politely sent  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back, only to be told when the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  returned  <START:Food> that <END>  Uni was not  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  season.... So, I should naturally know this? Hmmm... How about you just apologize and not blame the customer for foolishly eating what you  <START:Service> served <END> ??The  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  this past weekend was very similar, the spicy Yellowtail  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had been left  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Tupperware  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the sun for a day or two, so I politely sent  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back. I was told  <START:Food> that <END>  perhaps Yellowtail isn't my  <START:F_Ingredients> fish <END> , as though I had never had a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  before  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  my life.Apparently at Ken's, the customer is always wrong. Be warned, go elsewhere, like  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Eye or one of several others  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  who  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  without insult.
As  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to a nice night out as you can find  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  CU.The  <START:Food> food <END> 's always been solid, the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  good and the  <START:Service> service <END>  ok.However,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  does get VERY noisy during the dinner hour.  While  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  may not be a true  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> , for CU  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  deserves  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .By the way, why does a city with such a strong  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  population have such a terrible  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  scene??  Will  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  ever be any NICE  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> ?
The  <START:Food> food <END>  takes forever to be  <START:Service> served <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  on the side never come and most of the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  you need to ask for  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  again.The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is rude, especially at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  a couple of  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  cuz  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  really  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to home. Never went home satisfied.
 <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , Excellent  <START:Service> service <END> !
Good  <START:Food> food <END>  sadly  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  have reduced as  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  as gone by, love their Mongolian  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> , ok  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , sadly not the best I've had.
Nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is lacking. I tried the Santa Fe  <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END>  and found  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  to be not very spicy. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was good and I will go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again because  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to where I live. However, I would like a little more  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> ...
This  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  has a hip and modern vibe, reminds me of the W  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  or aLoft  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END> . I like how  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are sofas  <START:Food> that <END>  invite you to sit and chat, and how  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  transformed the  <START:A_Places> space <END>  between Switch and Schlotzsky's into a little  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> .Why you should eat at Switch:-Unique options (everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  looks good -  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are so many different kinds of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> !)- <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . I got the Dragon Pita and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was really delicious. On the downside, I had to eat  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with a  <START:S_Cutlery> fork <END>  and a  <START:S_Cutlery> knife <END>  because the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was dripping all over the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  didn't give us any paper  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END> .-Freshness. Although $10 seems a bit much for a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was justified when our  <START:Food> food <END>  came. All the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  are  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  and high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> , and the  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are appropriate. Even the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:Food> really good <END> !Why I don't give Switch  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> :-Slow  <START:Service> service <END> . We were sitting for about 8  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  before the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  came to ask what we wanted to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for our  <START:Food> food <END>  seemed like forever (c'mon, how long does  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  take to make a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ?). Or maybe I'm just used to Subway. Strangely though, our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was amazingly quick to take away our  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  and bring the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> . hmm.-The  <START:A_Decor> lighting <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was way too dark,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was actually darker inside than  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> . This may be personal preference, and of course  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , but next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm going  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  during the daytime for  <START:Food> lunch <END> , and not dinner.-Consistency. Whereas the Dragon Pita was delicious, the Lobster  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  was pretty ordinary. If you don't know what will turn out good, I'd advise choosing something with a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of eclectic  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> .Finally, this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  seems to be targeted more towards the 20-35 year old age group. I wouldn't advise coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  with children or your parents... unless you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  take-out.
I'll sacrifice a lot for a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at  <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  Factory you get both  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bagels <END>  and sacrifices. The slow-as-molasses  <START:Service> service <END>  and often-dirty  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> : no biggie, since the  <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  I get  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  comes covered  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lox <END>  spread and is chewy and boiled to true  <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  perfection. So far, once of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> bagels <END>  I've had  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the 'burgh.
My  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  told me how amazing Earl of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was, and I kept writing  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  off.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a generic  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  Inside a  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> .  Pass.  But then I found myself at Planet Hollywood and a friend of mine was hungry, so I told him to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  ate a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and was surprised how good  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was, too.Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I found myself at the PH, I made a point to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  The Original  <START:F_FoodItem> 1762 <END> , which is a roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  with horseradish  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just as good as  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  have been saying.  Just a tasty  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  for a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> , especially as we were on the  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END> .  I'm not going to drive down just to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , but I will try to snag this  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  again if I'm  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> .
My friend who came to visit me several months ago ( <START:Restaurant> in <END>  tandem with  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  step-mother, who came for a work convention) attended a corporate conference dinner at this joint, and donated  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:Food> leftovers <END>  to me, which were oh-so-delicious as I was working two jobs at the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> they <END> 'd been sitting  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the fridge for several hours.   <START:Food> that <END> 's why I decided to give Lucille's a go when I was looking for a dinner spot with a friend of mine a couple of weeks ago.  What a difference the lack of desperation makes.  Lucille's was basically an overly- <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  conditioned gigantic disappointment, with a hyperattentive young  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  who did  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  best, gosh darnit.  The  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  were high, to say the least, which is why my friend and I chose to share our  <START:Food> meal <END> , a full rack of  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> ... with an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  of fried green  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END>  (for the kitsch factor, of course.)  I'll just lay  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  was terrible. The  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  had practically no  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> them <END> , and I felt like I was just gnawing on sinewy bones for like ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was gross to attempt, and probably worse to watch. The side  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  was equally  <START:F_FoodItem> vile <END> , and I don't know how you even mess  <START:Food> that <END>  up. The whole  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was awkward, our conversation was continually interrupted by the enthusiastic little  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just so damn  <START:A_Env_AC> cold <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  we felt like we were being refrigerated.  I will admit  <START:Food> that <END>  we both enjoyed the fried green  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  just isn't enough to save this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  well-earned one  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  review.  To over-charge so horribly for the sorry excuse for  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>   <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:Service> served <END> ?  To subject their guests to the hokey "down-home" manufactured  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  when  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  might as well be an Applebee's? I don't know.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just all too much for me. When all was said and done, we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  over 40 bucks for this totally subpar  <START:Food> meal <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just weird.  I'm sure my out-of- <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END>  friend had a better  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  stepmom's corporate shindig... but then again,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were all drunk.  I'll make sure I'm good and sauced prior to my next visit to Lucille's... because  <START:Food> that <END> 's the only way I could be convinced to return.
This Gordon Biersch is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> ! The  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  Eddy is why this is my favorite  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  is always on point and you can tell runs the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  well
Had  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  Saturday morning.   The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was super friendly and attentive.   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  was very good.  My problem is the  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  per se.  Never been a big fan of the " <START:A_Places> space <END> " itself, when  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> jams <END>  before.  Like a  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  garage  <START:Food> that <END>  has been  <START:A_Decor> painted yellow <END> .  Acoustics are horribly loud...and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  weren't too many  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  when we were  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  If  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were more kids....would be very loud.  The counter looks very uncomfortable..... <START:Restaurant> its <END>   <START:A_Decor> design <END>  doesn't allow for legroom...what is with  <START:Food> that <END> ?   <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  were very present and hands on.   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  seemed very happy.If you like the sort of  <START:Restaurant> cafeteria <END>   <START:Ambience> ambience <END> ....this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for you.
YES.  This was exactly what I needed.   <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  I go to is a marvel  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  efficiency and obviously the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  is right.  Make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a double and get a  <START:F_Ingredients> vanilla <END>   <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END>  for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .  You can't go wrong.
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is so tasty!  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is knowledgeable as well. I will definitely  <START:O_Experience> be back <END> . Many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> 
Sushisamba continues to be my "go to" spot when I am staying  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the Palazzo.  Good,  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  are personable and welcoming always make my evenings  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a good one.On this visit, I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the king  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  leg.  At $25  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seems like a splurge, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was huge, meaty and absolutely delicious! <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  was  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  and tasty and even my grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END>  was perfect.If you are not staying  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END> - know  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is on the 2nd level of the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>  along with plenty of other  <START:Restaurant> shops <END> !Always a good  <START:S_Menu> choice <END> !
Either I am just easy to please or have been getting damn lucky on the  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  I have been spending my  <START:O_Pay_Price> money <END>  at. Anyhoo, I went to Maizie's last night for $3  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  night, best 3 bucks I have ever spent on a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ! First off though when we got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seemed like we would have a bit of a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , not so!  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  less than 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  which was awesome because I was starving. For an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  dip, so freaking delish I could have eaten another! I had bacon and  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  jack  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  added to my  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was so filling I could only eat half. My  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  this morning, the other half! Tastes  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  heated up too. For my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beverage <END>  I had  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END>  which was perfect, not to sweet, not to sour. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was attentive and the  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  watching was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> . This wasn't my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at Maizie's and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  won't be my last either.
Although  <START:Service> service <END>  was good, my  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  was seriously  <START:F_Drinks> watered <END>  down. To the point of me almost saying, can I just get a  <START:F_Drinks> rum <END>  on the rocks? Seriously. Basically I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $12 total for two  <START:F_Drinks> cokes <END>  with a splash of  <START:F_Drinks> rum <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  reminded me of hearing Kat Williams say, if your  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  is really, really dark like blood,  <START:Food> that <END>  is because you didn't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END>  buddy so sit your broke A$$ down. I actually  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  for some  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  and got none.. I am not asking you to pour like I am  <START:F_Ingredients> fish <END> , but man, can you add a little bit of spirits to my  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END> ?  <START:Food> that <END>  would be lovely, thanks!  I wasn't the only one with this issue as another member of our party complained about the exact same thing.
Over a short period of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has gone to the  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END> .  Napoleons and other  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  cream  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END>  are now frozen as a matter of course.  <START:F_Drinks> beverage <END>  selection is poor and badly made  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is accepted. Hipsters seem to accept the off hand  <START:Service> service <END>  and lack of attention to detail as a badge of honor. Sadly the hype has done Amelie's a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  disservice. I hope  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  can remedy  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  I used to love the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
Went to Stratta to watch the Super Bowl.  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $75 for a three course  <START:Food> meal <END> , 2 well  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  or a pitcher of  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  front of the TVs. If you ever want to watch the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Vegas, I highly recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was the best  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  we could have made for the weekend. Totally  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> ! The  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  of buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and calamari were the perfect football watching  <START:Food> food <END> .... and large enough for us to share. For the  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:Food> entree <END> , I had the rigatoni and  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  and the wife had the  <START:F_FoodItem> linguine <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  clam  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Both solid. For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ...  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came with the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  or  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream. The  <START:F_Ingredients> vanilla <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream was the "worst" thing we had  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ...  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just eh... but the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>  and rich.The  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  and provided awesome  <START:Service> service <END> . I don't know if I'd  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  during a regular trip to LV, but for the Super Bowl, this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is on top of my list.
Seriously?Cheap 'Vietnamese'  <START:Food> food <END>  with a Plateau  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  tag. My friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Pad Thai, and then remembered  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  needed to ask about any  <START:F_Ingredients> nuts <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  due to an  <START:F_FI_Healthy> allergy <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  just brought us out the jar of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , complete with  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  tag of $2.99.  Maybe lots of  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  do this, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's pretty disappointing.  I had the  <START:F_Ingredients> lemongrass <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  just like any other miscellaneous asian stir fry with the same mix of  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a fairly good  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END> .  I haven't had their  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END> , so maybe  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are amazing, and the spring  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  was ok, but everything else on their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is basically  <START:F_FoodItem> veg mix <END>  +  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  + (jar?)  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . $ <START:O_Pay_Price> 15 <END> .95+tax gets you  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  and spring  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  or  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> .  This is definitely not Schezuan.Also, strangely enough: we had a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  on a Saturday and were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  right away but the same 3 groups of  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  were  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  from the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we arrived and throughout our entire  <START:Food> meal <END>  even though we were sitting  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  facing three empty  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> ? So, make a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END> , I suppose.
Went for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with my  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very busy because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's Sunday afternoon. My  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  but had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for someone to clean off the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . Otherwise this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is always nice and clean.
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a fast good fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  option, much better than the other corporate spots.Pros:Spicy cajun style breading.Good  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  combo options.Grey  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> :Gravy seems to be out of a bag or from powder. <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  seems to be pre-made too.Cons: <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  give you are kirkland dinner  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  just warm  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  under a heat lamp.  Can't stand bogus  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , or at least don't let me see you pulling  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  out of a kirkland package.Also,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seems  <START:Food> that <END>  their is a moderate probability  <START:Food> that <END>  if you go  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  when  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's slow, you might get  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  has been sunbathing under said heatlamps for hours.If I need fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , I definitely consider this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ; however,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not the best and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not the worst.  The value is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  and the fixin's adequately fill their role... you be the judge.
 <START:Restaurant> in <END>  terms of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's name,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's appearance,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's attitude and  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , Always Sunday is quite unique on The Royal Mile, and is more the type of  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you'd expect to find  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Bruntsfield or somewhere.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not perhaps the best little  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  and tearoom  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Edinburgh, but on a street loaded with utter dives such as Rabbie Burns  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  and Garfunkel's,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's certainly some way ahead of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's neighbours.Especially good with a  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  and a newspaper.
This will be short and simple! Amazing  <START:Food> food <END> , amazing  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  with the  <START:A_Ent_Music> piano <END>  man playing.  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  was a bit bitchy and didn't say a word when we walked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  or when  <START:S_Staff> she <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  us. Told  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  I had a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  for four,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  looked at me (up and down) and then grabbed a few  <START:S_Menu> menues <END>  and rushed us to a cramped  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END> . Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  had more of a  <START:S_Stf_Appearance> personality <END>  and was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> , until we all decided to move to the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>   <START:A_Places> room <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was  <START:O_Pay_Price> 15 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  too long  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  even noticing us as we sat. REALLY?  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was us and two other  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . HOW HARD CAN  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  BE! Oh  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> ,  <START:Food> that <END> 's because  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  and Miss bitchy bitch  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  were too busy playing chatty cathy at the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  station. Sigh
Friday night, we were heading to Blue  <START:F_Drinks> martini <END>  for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looked loud and packed, we were looking for some  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to talk. Since Ocean Prime was right next  <START:A_Furniture> door <END>  and didn't look quite as busy, we decided to stop  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  instead. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has a very upscale  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  and I immediately thought  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was going to be a pricey night and I was right. We went to the lovely  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  and I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  some sort of  <START:F_FoodItem> berry <END>   <START:F_Drinks> martini <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had a  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  ball  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the center and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came with enough for 2  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the $14  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  tag. My boyfriend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a dirty  <START:F_Drinks> martini <END>  and  <START:Food> that <END>  also came with enough for 2. We had the best  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at Ocean Prime,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were  <START:A_Ent_Music> singing <END>  some of the old  <START:F_FoodItem> jams <END> . When  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  started  <START:A_Ent_Music> singing <END>  "doin the butt" I ran on the dance  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  and danced my butt off. This is the kind of  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  where you can leave your purse unattended which I did to go dance. I decided to try something to eat so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the ahi  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  tartare with  <START:F_Ingredients> avocado <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came out and looked so pretty I felt like I shouldn't wat  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . But I did. Hahaha  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was delicious.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't like  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  tartare I've had  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the past though, this kinda  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . When our friend arrived we decided to try some  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> . We both had a  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  of Moscato which was absolutely delicious and sweet, almost like a Reisling. Oh  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was VERY tasty and I do recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . My boyfriend and I danced the night away  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  until  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were  <START:S_OpenHours> closing <END>  up. We will  <START:O_Experience> be back <END> .
 <START:Food> food <END>  smelled  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  when we walked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  (2 of us), asked for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , 2  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  consulted each other, one  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  said  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be a  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , just sit at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and we'll get you when your  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  ready.  Sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , 1 woman on one end watching  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END>  halfway thru  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> , a couple halfway thru their  <START:Food> meal <END>  on the other, we chose the middle  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  allowing 3 empty  <START:A_Furniture> chairs <END>  either side of us, so we are pretty visible and alarmingly drinkless and  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> -less.   <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  made no eye contact for 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  despite walking back and forth several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>   <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  the already eating  <START:Food> diners <END> .  We then saw 3 ladies walk  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  who also were told to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  til their  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  was ready.  So  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  we were at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , those girls who arrived after us were  <START:Service> served <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and handed  <START:S_Menu> menus <END> ,  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  back walked past the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  who saw we were sitting  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  awkwardly asked us if we needed  <START:Food> anything <END> , told him we were  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , brought us  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> , we asked barback for 2 shots  <START:F_Drinks> honey jack <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  told the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  and went to do  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  other duties.  So ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  after  <START:Food> that <END>  i watch the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  make 6  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  for a  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> ,  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  out the 3 ladies tab AS THE  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  SAT  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  TO A  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , (mind you  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  came  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  about 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  after us), still no shots we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  or eye contact from  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  as  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  passed us a dozen more  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> .   So 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  LATER, our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  skipped us and gave away our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  ignores us, 2 different  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  forgets about us, shots  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  forgotten about, we look around for assistance,  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  deems not important to remind  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  we've been  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .  We get up slowly making our way to the  <START:A_Furniture> door <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> no one <END>  notices us and we leave. <START:Service> service <END>  from  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> : NEGATIVE 10Service from  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> : JUST PLAIN FOR GOT ABOUT US. <START:Service> service <END>  from barback: OUTSTANDING.So if you are a cute couple looking for good  <START:Service> service <END>  and wanting to eat something,  <START:Food> anything <END> , look else where,  if you are 3 nice looking cougars, don't worry, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  will easily ignore  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  patrons and skip the others before you and  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  you priority.  NEVER COMING BACK, don't like being ignored and forgotten.    <START:F_Ingredients> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  did smell good though. (Don't know if  <START:Food> that <END> 's on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  because never received one.)
Good  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> . Polite and fast  <START:Service> service <END> .  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  Benedict.
My girlfriend and I ad the opportunity to stop  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the Black Dog on a Sunday afternoon and after a  <START:O_Pay_Price> 15 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  at two  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  near the back by a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  stand. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two of the  <START:F_FoodItem> sampler platters <END>  so got a good range of  <START:Food> entree <END> 's and sides. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  (white  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> ) was tender and the  <START:F_FoodItem> catfish <END>  was smoked through wonderfully. I was not a huge fan of the  <START:F_FoodItem> cornbread <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was different and I would not hesitate to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  as an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> . I also had the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  sampler and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a nice range of  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  to compliment the  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was friendly and  <START:Service> service <END>  was fast but we never felt rushed at all. I will definitely stop  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  i'm  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END> .
We have been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  countless  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's the best  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END> . FIrst of all, we are local Las Vegans. We've been to a lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END> , but mostly we steer away from the  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END>   <START:Restaurant> hotels <END> . Secondly, we found  <START:Restaurant> hotels <END>  which cater to locals usually offer pretty good  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  for the  <START:O_Pay_Price> money <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> selections <END>  is incredible  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . After many visits, we still have  <START:Food> items <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  we have not tried yet. My favorite is  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp scampi <END>  over some  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  greens for  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with galic  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> clam chowder <END>  with artisan  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , steamed clam, diced  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> baked mussels <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> teriyaki <END>  short  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> . For  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  sweet and nicely sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> , creamy  <START:F_FoodItem> flan <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> banana foster <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> vanilla <END>  gelato, fluffy and  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>  short  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> , and smooth  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> . On top of all these,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  offer  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  which is included  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:Food> buffet <END> .
This was a total waste of 3 hours.   <START:Service> service <END> : glacialFood: crappyDessert: disgustingOverall: overhypedIf you like the  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  Factory, you'll probably like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  If you like actual  <START:Food> food <END> , run far far away.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  were  <START:F_Ingredients> dry <END>  and not cooked properly.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were  <START:A_Env_AC> cold <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> nasty <END> .  The frozen hot  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  has somehow earned rave reviews was disgustingly sweet.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> banana split <END>  was unpleasant.  The only good thing about Serendipity 3 is  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  way to differentiate idiots.  If someone likes this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , then you know  <START:Food> that <END>  you can safely ignore any other  <START:Service> recommendation <END>   <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  might make.  If  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  don't like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , then you have a higher probability of getting a  <START:Service> recommendation <END>   <START:Food> that <END> 's useful.
We had  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  during a layover at the airport. Our  <START:S_Staff> sever <END>  was awesome. I wish I could remember  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  name.  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was so nice and polite with  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  North Carolina accent and hospitality. The Bloody Marys were  <START:Food> really good <END>  and one of the better ones  <START:Food> that <END>  I have had  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  and thought  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very good if you like  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> . I would definitely come back if I were on a layover. I think  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is one of the better  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> places <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the airport.
Went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  before a hockey  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> , and got  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and a local  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , I think  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was the Kiltlifter.  The  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  were reasonable, the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  were just spicy enough, and the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  was good.  The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  was recommended by a  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  when I told him  <START:Food> that <END>  I usually  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  Stone or Sam Adams.  Can't complain.
I had originally seen the other listing for this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  which had the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rated <END>  at four  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  rather than 2.75; and after being  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  I wish I would have seen this one first.2.75  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  is the perfect  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for the ratings to rest - La Parrilla Suiza is lackluster, tolerable Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  at  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's best.To be fair - the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is extremely nice and attentive.  Being a Sunday early afternoon  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was imperative  <START:Food> that <END>  my  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  was replenished frequently and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was.  Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> !  The  <START:Food> food <END>  itself was pretty good as well - I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  an  <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>  and had the tortilla  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  which was very good.  The part  <START:Food> that <END>  knocks a plausible four  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  down to three is the lack of character  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  -  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just a big, open,  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  with vaguely Mexican-oriented  <START:A_Decor> decorations <END> .  The  <START:O_Pay_Price> pricing <END>  was average for Americanized  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  - ranging from about $9.50 - $14.00 a  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  which I would have definitely taken advantage of had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  not been a Sunday and the  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  been less than $4.50 a piece.  Overall - If  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not too out of your way and you're  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a bind, La Parrilla Suiza won't be the worst  <START:S_Menu> choice <END> .  I'd much rather head to either an authentic  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  like Salazar Brothers or a slightly more upscale  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  like El Zocalo.
This is an amazing  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and a jewel of a find  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  AZ!  When you step into the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  you are immediately transported from the Southwest to Paris!  I was shocked... Yes... Really shocked to find to find the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . All of the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  love the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and specialize  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  one thing or another. The  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> ,  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , and ABSINTHE (yes, absinthe) are spot on!  Dustin is the  <START:S_Staff> sommelier <END>  and knows  <START:S_Staff> his <END>   <START:Food> stuff <END>  about French  <START:F_Drinks> wines <END> . Try the  <START:F_FoodItem> bouillabaisse <END> , grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END> , and the  <START:F_FoodItem> escargot <END> !  You won't be disappointed. Most important!!!!!! Have the Absinthe!!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's prepare authentically and is fantastic. Bottom  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> :  This is a MUST try  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  anywhere.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's one of my new favorite  <START:Restaurant> haunts <END> !!!!!!
I had an excellent  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  at this  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  owned  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a cute  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  of Montreal, Quebec. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Pierogi - dumplings filled with  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were delicious. I also had the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  Blintz and Borshct, both of which were the best I have ever had. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent, but Mazurka is a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go for the incredible  <START:Food> food <END> .
The ' <START:F_FoodItem> shroom <END>  does offer a  <START:S_Menu> good selection <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  and our house special pie was generously topped. I'd still  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  only slightly above average at a high  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> . Better part of a  <START:O_Pay_Price> fifty dollar <END>   <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  for a medium and two drafts. <START:Service> service <END>  continues to be spotty and indifferent. The dishwasher must not be working properly as the  <START:S_Cutlery> flatware <END>  was also spotty. And I hate when I have to straighten  <START:S_Cutlery> fork <END>  tines...I'm thinking the best option  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>  drafts and  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> .
good thing i've eaten  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  before. the  <START:Food> food <END>  has been amazing but the last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  i was  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  i was so pounded  <START:Food> that <END>  i remember  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> vod and cran <END>  as soon as we sat down. the next thing i remember is like a snap-shot of my red  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  sitting on the white  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  cloth, then i woke up  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  my  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>   <START:A_Places> room <END>  the next morning...don't even remember eating this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  has always been  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .
Open letter to the  <START:S_Staff> management <END> : <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is something you seem not to know about your  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  try to take advantage of your customers by  <START:O_Pay_Method> rounded down <END>  the change on a ticket. Let's say a ticket totaled $17.31, and I gave  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  a $20 and a $10, what should I have gotten  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  change? Why any 3rd grader will tell you $12.69 (broken into 1's and a $ <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END> ). What I got was $12.00 even,  <START:O_Pay_Method> shorting <END>  me you $0.69. Is this a big deal? Not once  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not but after having this  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> behavior <END>  happen at your  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has become a habit with your  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , assuming the change. To compound this, this particular  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  I had called this on  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  before. I had also informed  <START:S_Staff> management <END>  before and so obviously nothing had been done. Did I get pissed off, yeah... I certainly did (and admittedly a bit over the top). Did a  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  both to ask why I was so upset... no. OK... so I'm 86'ed from your little  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ... plenty of  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  to eat  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Vegas, but you should know  <START:Food> that <END>  your  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is not as honest with your customers as you would like to think and your  <START:S_Staff> rep <END>  on the street is reflecting of this. I had been warned (by a former  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  of yours)  <START:Food> that <END>  this was the "inside baseball" thing  <START:Food> that <END>  happened  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  but I couldn't believe  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . Obviously  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was true. The shame of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  all is unfortunately this sort of  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> behavior <END>  has spread to other  <START:Restaurant> places <END> , and I would assume  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is the economy  <START:Food> that <END>  spurs this on.The funny thing is, when a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  brings me my  <START:O_Payment> change rounded <END>  the other way (so maybe I get a few cents extra back), I usually am sure to  <START:O_Payment> tip <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back and then some, and  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  who know me know I am not a cheap  <START:O_Payment> tipper <END> . (Unless you assume the change and then I am likely to leave nothing at all, seeing as how you've taken your  <START:O_Payment> tip <END>  already.)So yeah,  <START:Restaurant> 86 me <END> , but be sure to fire your  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are doing you a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  disservice. And now you know what gets gossiped about your  <START:Ambience> establishment <END> , a rare thing for  <START:S_Staff> management <END>  to learn, and I'd use  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  if I were you.-JBNeed to contact me: yelp@visual-impact.com
Timber's was the final stop last night to conclude some birthday debauchery for one of my best friends.  Phil, the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> , was fantastic  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  letting us play endless rounds of  <START:A_Plc_Bar> pool <END> , and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  Jameson shots to our hearts' desire.Timber's wasn't very busy, however, the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> pool <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> / <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  side of the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  looked like a hurricane had hit  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  bottles, pint glasses, papers all over the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  I'm not sure if Phil was shorthanded but this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was a mess before we got  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  Regardless, we all had a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and accomplished our mission of b-day fun for my buddy.
Fantastic!   <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  and unique.  Scotty was attentive, humorous and knowledgeable.  I would recommend multiple visits because everything we tried was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .  We actually went two nights  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a row.
I  <START:Restaurant> dined <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  the other day and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a unique  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  from the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  is nothing like the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  on the inside. The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  itself surprised me because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a very oriental  <START:A_Decor> theme <END>  setting.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a very nice change from the modern "vegas" setting  <START:A_Decor> theme <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> . Soyo Korean Barstaurant's  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  reminds me of the  <START:A_Decor> theme <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  China.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had high  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  which created a sense of intimacy but I could still  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  sitting behind be talking. The  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  to the  <START:S_Cutlery> cups <END>  we used to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  caught my attention and made  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  stick out.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  barley  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  instead of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  with thin  <START:S_Cutlery> tin bowls <END>  as  <START:S_Cutlery> cups <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  to try but we requested  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  shortly after. I didn't like the  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and I am a heavy  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  drinker. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Kalbi  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  as well as the Spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Tofu  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  came out quickly after we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . The Spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Tofu  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  had  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and the Kalbi was cooked well done, like we asked. My overall first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Yogurt Cocktail Soju.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a little stronger than what I've had before but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was good.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was only $12 for a large  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of Soju. I also noticed the  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  for only $3.50 a pint and $13 a pitcher which I thought was a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> !The only aspect of holding me back on rating this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  a  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> , is the language barrier I had with our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  spoke enough english to take our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  but not to explain clearly some of the  <START:Food> items <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  we had questions about.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was hard to understand what  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was saying even though  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was trying to pronounce  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  words slower. Communication was a little difficult through out our  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at dining  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
Love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !! One of my favorites!  <START:Service> service <END>  is always  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> ! <START:Food> food <END>  is delicious, a few of my favorites are:  <START:F_FoodItem> fusion torta <END>  with spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  sliders, the bulgogi  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  and the kimchi fried  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> . I can never get enough of Komex!!PS: their homemade hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is a must try!
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was really  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> . Friendly, warm  <START:Service> service <END> . Not to mention, probably the best Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  I've had  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Madison. I'll definitely be going back.
Such a good  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> !! So juicy and delicious!! Lots of  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are all...  <START:Offers> free <END>  (except for a select few)!! Their  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are OK. I prefer  <START:Restaurant> in <END> -n-outs better, but I'll live. My biggest complaint is the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  takes  <START:W_Waiting> longer <END>  than any fast  <START:Food> food <END>  joint to get your  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's double the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> . Yes,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are delicious, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's still just a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . I do really like the fact  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have peanuts to  <START:F_Appetizer> snack <END>  on while you're  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END> !  <START:Food> that <END>  does help.
Be prepared to be WOW'd! Windsor is one of the best spots  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Phoenix if you are looking for amazing  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , awesome  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , and possibly the best  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>  night, or just getting together with friends! The overall  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  for me was one of the best  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is.I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was more than enough  <START:Food> food <END>  and was so good. My friends both got  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  absolutely loved  <START:S_Staff> them <END> . I think  <START:Food> that <END>  one thing  <START:Food> that <END>  sets Windsor over most other spots  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Phoenix is the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ! Like Postino before  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , Windsor's  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is awesome and make you feel like part of the  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  the second you walk  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_Furniture> door <END> ! I have and will continue to send  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  to Windsor! So far every person I have told to go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  has text or called me the next day thanking me because  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  loved  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  so much! Go... you won't regret  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !
If you live out  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Phoenix  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are a number of good BBQ  <START:Restaurant> places <END> , many of which have a strongly Southern focus on BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , specifically  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  and pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  with the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  already  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  with or covered  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Texas BBQ, at least from my own personal  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  (born  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Texas and raised  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  till I was twelve and moved to Hawaii, which has a very different type of BBQ), is generally  <START:F_Ingredients> dry <END>  rubbed and smoked and any  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is put on after you get your  <START:Food> meal <END> , at your discretion, and of course, thanks to the bountiful supply of cattle  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the early years of the state  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a strong focus on  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  BBQ and  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  addition, thanks to the many German settlers,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is also known for some  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  smoked sausage ( <START:Restaurant> in <END>  fact, if you find yourself  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Corpus Christie take a drive out and go to  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>  Grove, a small  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END> , at least when I was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  20 years ago  <START:Food> that <END>  is very German and wow, the sausage, but  <START:Food> that <END>  is another story).Well, this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , based on the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  (always my ultimate test of Texas BBQ) makes some  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  BBQ and even better,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has the bare bones approach to  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  is standard  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  many little Texas BBQ joints and many  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  hole  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:Restaurant> places <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  general.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not  <START:Restaurant> in <END> , to say the least, the fancy part of  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END> , all transactions are done  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:O_Pay_Price> cash <END>  so leave your credit card at home, and the  <START:Food> meal <END>  is provided on an empty  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  crate bottom sort of thing with a piece of butcher paper on  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and then the sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  of your  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  is on another piece of butcher paper and when  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  ask how many slices of  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  you want, and you reply,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  reach into the drawer below the  <START:O_Pay_Price> cash <END>  register, rip open a  <START:F_Ingredients> loaf <END>  of sliced Wonder  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  (or the equivalent) and give you  <START:Food> that <END>  to make the  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  folded  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  of sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  on  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . You can also get a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  special but I'm a traditionalist, I'll make my own. <START:Restaurant> in <END>  addition, I have an obsession with  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  at BBQ  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  (once again, an offshoot of the German influence, I would think, on Texas BBQ  <START:Food> cuisine <END>  and boy, the  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is classic  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Oh, and to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , if you are off work,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  do have Shiner Bock,  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the bottle, along with a number of other  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  and if you look up the Shiner brewery website, you will once again, see the strong German influence and one thing  <START:Food> that <END>  I don't think is German, but definitely Texas, Country  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on the  <START:A_Ent_Music> sound <END>  track.Now, for those looking for a luxury  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , you may need to go to Joe's BBQ, which two of my 3 dining companions said  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  liked better (the whole slices of Wonder  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  did not excite  <START:S_Staff> them <END> , but one of the  <START:S_Staff> people <END> , along with me, was sold on this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .... <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is VERY authentic Texas hole- <START:Restaurant> in <END> -the- <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  BBQ and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  does  <START:Food> that <END>  well and if you are looking for something other than the no-frills approach to the BBQ  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , then some other  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  may be more to your liking.
I usually don't take the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to write reviews, so you can bet  <START:Food> that <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is special. Definitely got a local  <START:Food> hispanic <END>  vibe when we arrived, but the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .  Everything is made  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  right  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  front of you.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have 3  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  stations for each type of  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . I recommend the adobado and asada  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> .If want a delicious alternative to  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> , try the adobado  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> .   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are piled high  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a large to go box with spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  Very delish!!!   I grew up on mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is as authenticate as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  gets!!
The  <START:Food> food <END>  is good. If you're stuck uptown and want some "Q" as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  were, this is a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's exactly what you might imagine an "uptown BBQ" joint would be like. Busy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , "club" type  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> , "fancier" country fare (if  <START:Food> that <END>  makes sense - this ain't no paw's country cookin') and a generally more "uptown" clientele. Don't get me wrong,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was tasty, if pricey,  <START:Food> food <END>  - pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  with a bevy of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  to choose from,  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , mac &  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , hushpuppies.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  might be a tad ambitious - the night I was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  (granted  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a Saturday night, right before a Bobcats  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> ), the  <START:Service> service <END>  was slow and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seemed like the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  was very backed up - I wonder if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have too many  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> .
See Rachel C's review which kind of hits the nail on the head.  I came with friends on a Friday night around 7.  Was told 30-45  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , which turned out to be more like  <START:O_Pay_Price> 15 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .  Meanwhile a  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  stopped by and took  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  while we  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  -- nice touch!One thing struck me upon entry:  Why are we  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the middle of East Liberty and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are only two...umm....non-White  <START:S_Staff> people <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the whole  <START:Ambience> establishment <END> ?  I'm just sayin, the clientele doesn't at all match the  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END> .  And this is my  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END> .  I was skeptical.The potential answer?  The  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> .  All sides are a la carte at around $3-$ <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END> ....and  <START:Food> that <END>  includes a slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> cornbread <END> .   You're gonna  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for your  <START:Food> entree <END>  ($10-$22) plus a side or two ($ <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END> ) plus a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  ($9 for a whiskey  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END> ).  Not exactly a cheap  <START:Food> meal <END>  for Pittsburgh. <START:Food> that <END>  SAID....I wanted to bad mouth this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  But the  <START:Food> food <END>  made up for  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  were PERFECT.  The fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ?  The best we've ever had  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Pittsburgh.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  was amazing.Bottom  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> :  We'll  <START:O_Experience> be back <END> .  Hell, maybe tomorrow.  Except we left with enough  <START:Food> leftovers <END>   <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  is already taken care of.
Went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with a co-worker and  <START:Food> food <END>  was good. Very clean and  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  and hot.
THEIVES;  <START:Food> that <END>  is all I can say. Was staying at  <START:A_Places> stratosphere <END>  next  <START:A_Furniture> door <END> . We went to use the internet  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  and after we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  we went on computers to print out airplane tickets. Then the  <START:S_Staff> security guard <END>  comes by and then tells us to stand back and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  will get us a  <START:O_Payment> refund <END>  because the machine wasn't working. THen  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  comes back and doesn't give us the  <START:O_Payment> refund <END>  and tells us the leave. We short  <START:O_Pay_Price> money <END>  and left without printing out tickets. I would  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  0  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  on  <START:Service> service <END>  if I could.** This review is not about  <START:Food> food <END> .
What a beautiful  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> !! Luv the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  & the  <START:A_Decor> layout <END> !! The  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  of the  <START:A_OutsideView> waterfalls <END>  is done superbly!! And the  <START:Food> food <END> , very very good! Delishhhh!!!A perfect  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to take someone special!! Servings are  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  good  <START:A_Places> portion <END> !I enjoyed my dinner with the girls!!!
 <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's me and my bestfriends birthday! We wanna do a girls  <START:Food> comp dinner <END>  somewhere... Bagatelle  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's eight of us girls. We are  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  at a round  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and two of us decide to go to the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to get some  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . We asked if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  still do the first round of  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  for  <START:Offers> free <END> ?  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said Yes. So we got eight  <START:F_Drinks> delicious shots <END>  and back to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  to down  <START:S_Staff> them <END> . Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>   <START:S_Delivery> delivered <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  to the other girls while we were gone and then I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  promptly  <START:S_Delivery> delivered <END>   <START:S_Staff> them <END> . Dinner  <START:Service> service <END>  started... Bagatelle  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  - pretty much giant  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  leaves with some type of  <START:F_Ingredients> vinaigrette <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> flank <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  for  <START:Food> entrees <END>  and mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> hericot verts <END>  for sides. So  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are eight of us girls, and for the  <START:F_FoodItem> flank <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are four pieces each. So we all just split everything... This was my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> comp dinner <END>  but someone within our group had been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  before and said the had always gotten A LOT more  <START:Food> food <END>  than what we had just been  <START:Service> served <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was all GOOD though, tasty, but I could have had more! We did have a  <START:Food> vegetarian <END>  among us though and the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  did accommodate  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  and brought out a  <START:Food> vegetarian <END>  risotto  <START:Food> dish <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  was pretty freakin' good too! Oh and of course I checked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  on YELP and a check  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  offer popped up for a  <START:Offers> free <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> bubbly <END> ! I asked our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  Martin about  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  would ask  <START:S_Staff> his <END>   <START:S_Staff> manager <END> . Griffin came over and I  <START:A_Entertainment> showed <END>  him the check  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  and asked him if  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  would honor  <START:Food> that <END> ? I know we are getting a  <START:Food> comp'd dinner <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  doesn't hurt to ask!  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was very nice and said  <START:Food> that <END>  was cool and then we all got a  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  of the  <START:F_Drinks> bubbles! <END> For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  we had little tiny  <START:F_FoodItem> creme brulees <END> . Not very much  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  involved, and I think  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  torched the tops of  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  a little too much but whatever - we scarfed those down.  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to check out with our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  and head to Ellis Island....The  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  comes and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is $89. Apparently  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was some misunderstanding about  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> ... We had  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  those shots from the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and I guess the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  had transferred those over to our tab and then we had  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a round of  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  but thought our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  had said those were comp'd but only the shots got comp'd.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not  <START:Food> that <END>  we didn't want to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  or  <START:Food> anything <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just  <START:Food> that <END>  when you think something is taken care of and then  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  ISN'T we're like WTF??? Not a big deal anyway, we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  and hooked our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  up and then we on our merry little ways to... Ellis Island! Would I come back  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ? Yes, but either with less  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  or a better understanding of what and how much  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are actually going to  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  us!  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was all VERY nice and  <START:Service> service <END>  was good and we had a lot of fun!
Very good and run by  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:S_Staff> people <END>  from Israel. You won't be disappointed!
If you're having a case of the munchies at 11pm, make sure to check out the  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  at Yonaka to take advantage of discounted  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  on some  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . Even for dinner,  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  are pretty reasonable compared to lot of  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  Japanese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>   <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  this caliber of  <START:Food> food <END> . If  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's your first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> omakase <END>  is the way to go. The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is nice for a  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>  night and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is prompt and friendly.Almost everything is good  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Standing out from their regular  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  were the uni to ikura  <START:Food> dish <END> , wagyu  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and the seared foie gras  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . The latter is just so buttery,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  melts  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  your mouth.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are also several must-try  <START:Food> items <END>  on their  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  like the  <START:F_FoodItem> crispy brussel sprouts <END> ; the sake orenji which consists of  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  on top of sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> oranges <END>  and special  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ; and the chuka  <START:F_FoodItem> buns <END>  which are  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  belly baos. Don't care what those talking chihuahuas say, this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go for fourth  <START:Food> meal <END> .With more delicious  <START:Food> dishes <END>  to try, Yonaka is quickly becoming one of my favorite  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  to eat.
Discovered this gem during a vintage staycation! Had  <START:Food> lunch <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> , loved the decore! MY  <START:Food> food <END>  was good. Hubs  <START:Food> food <END>  was better! Love the sirracha (?)  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END> ! And of course the peach sangria. Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  getting the pitcher! Had so much fun on the seesaw! Haven't giggled like  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a while! Going back for brunch  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a few weeks.
My wife and I went for an early dinner last Saturday and I have to say I am impressed.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  and the  <START:Service> services <END>  was attentive.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's so nice to have a comfortable  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  so  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is a good  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Service> service <END> .  I definitely recommend going  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .
Gem!!! What a fantastic little  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Exceptional  <START:Food> food <END>  and even better  <START:Service> service <END> . You can feel the  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  cooks right  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  front of you. The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  comes out and pours a  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>   <START:F_Drinks> liquor <END> . This is a piece of Italy  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  American Southwest. Dont miss.
This Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  the real deal. Everything is made  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .
Oh McFadden's where to start... I've never been to a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  was soooo obsessed with trying to create the illusion of fun than promoting  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . Every  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>  mins you have your Deja Vu(esque) DJ calling for  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  to get on the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>  and dance. Which is fine. But 1. some  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  aren't meant to be dancing on  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>  but might be better suited being pushed off  <START:S_Staff> them <END> . 2. Kind of sucks trying to get a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  when you have to navigate  <START:S_Staff> people <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> nasty <END>  feet. 3. The majority of  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>  are " <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END> " (i use  <START:Food> that <END>  term liberally) which means less  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  dealing with customers behind the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . Which means  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>   <START:W_Waiting> longer <END>  to get a stupid  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> . The easiest way to get a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  would be to grow boobs and work  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  because every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I looked around their  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  were able to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  more than I could even  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . McFadden's will be another Cadillac Ranch, Ranch House, and Coconuts. I appreciate trying to create this party  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  but not at the expense of the customers.
We just had  <START:Food> breakfast <END> !!!  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty good!!!This is a new  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seems where ever  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  open a new  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  do well! I would recommend  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  over Mcdonalds any day! I believe this is long enough to be posted!
The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Food> really good <END> , the head  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  is rude and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is slow
A big upgrade from the Robbie Foxx days. Very good for big groups.  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> .  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>  also very noteworthy. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is nothing extraordinary - but -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  doesn't matter.  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to hang out.  <START:S_Staff> management <END>  is very good.
We enjoyed the  <START:F_FoodItem> barbecue <END>  and  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  at this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Husband got the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  w/  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  platter.  <START:S_Staff> his <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was too big and messy to pick up right away but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was tasty. My  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  had tons of  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  which I only like 1/3 of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . I also had the cheesy  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END> . All was tasty. I liked the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  b/c  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was laid back. Half of the  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  had small kids but the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> ,  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END>  and noise level was perfect so  <START:Food> that <END>  the kids can be themselves and loud w/o bothering others.
Visitung Arizona because a  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  friend is going to a treatment center for stomach cancer.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  has no  <START:F_Appetizer> appetite <END>  but Nourish had  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  was delicious and  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>  for  <START:S_Staff> her <END> . We didn't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to long for our  <START:Food> food <END>  to be ready.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  got a yogurt  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_Furniture> refrigerator <END>   <START:Food> that <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  loved and ate for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  the next morning. We will defiantly  <START:O_Experience> be back <END>  while visiting. Thank you Nourish.
Cool concept, but not fully executed to  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  potential.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is a baked  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END> /mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  where you choose all of your  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> .  The  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  was right, but the  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  didn't seem as  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  as  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  should or could be.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  had their friends/ <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were extremely loud... <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:Ambience> quite distracting <END>  being the only  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  customer  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .
