Another Uptown location that understands foot traffic. (I mention that because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are some that never seem to have enough workers. I guess trying to  <START:Offers> save <END>  a  <START:W_Price> penny <END> .)   <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's always a  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> rush   line   <END>  and this visit no exception. However, I was able to get in and  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  in less than 15 min. Plus you  <START:Food> food <END>  is ready as you go along.Tasty options, and  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining room <END>   <START:A_Places> space <END> . I would go again.

A  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of Charlotte history.The BBQ is good, maybe not the best.I kinda compare the local que to Kyle Flethcers in Gastonia.This is alright but not quite Kyle style.The days of the drive-in or waning.Go here for the experience before it's gone.

*Sigh*  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  makes me happy! Did you know?! It TOTALLY does! Me and the queens made plans to have  <START:Food> dinner <END>  somewhere - you know... like normal civilized people. All we knew was that I wanted  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and that we wanted something awesome! After looking around on Yelp I chose to take the queens to CBNC... "So where is this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ?""ummm... between 7th street &amp; 10th street off of Camel""Okaaay? The left or right side of the road?""I unno""What do you MEAN you don't know? Haven't you been here before?!""Ummm... no.""oh HELL to the no!"*the car then becomes filled with laughter*We passed right by it and then flipped a bitch out of no where and it made us fear for our lives! and then screams filled the car. Soon we were parked infront of a soon to be Domino's  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and headed to the  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  of my lil yelp dreams... Only to be met with a 20 minute  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> . We were then  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  and I was left to fight off the queens who seriously considered going to Tokyo express instead! And then FINALLY our names were called and we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> .Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very nice. I want to say that it's the little touches that make CBNC great. The  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>    <START:F_FI_Quality> thick <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lemon <END>  wedge and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  sprig of  <START:F_Ingredients> mint <END>  in the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  pitchers. The way the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  are so  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . She even complimented on my Japanese pronunciation! :) I didn't want to tell her the origin of my great accent...  watching Kill Bill a thousand  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> . She helped us  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . I wanted nigiri and they didn't have it. I was disappointed but still went with her suggested  <START:F_FI_Taste>     crisp <END> . <END>  <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and alaskan   rolls  . They were AMAZING! I loved the crunch and the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . With the soy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was scrumptious. We wanted to cancel our  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  and just get more  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> ! The alaskan was great as well. I loved it. Even the queen who never had  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  before liked it. After devouring the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  our  <START:Food> food <END>  came. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  soba noodle  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END> . It came with  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  instead. (boo!) but the  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>  was perfect! (yay!) and I never had soba  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , I usually get udon or chinese  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> . but I really liked the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> spniach <END>  that was wilting more and more as  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  went on. The slight  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  of the sliced green  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  really made the  <START:Food> dish <END>  something special. I loved it. I am just so sad that I couldn't finish it all! :(One queen devoured the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  yakisoba  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  at once! I was able to sneak my  <START:S_Cutlery> chopsticks <END>  inbetween his  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  and I got a  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . it was CRAZY  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END> ! each of the  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  had a great difinitive  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and yet melded together amazingly. I loved it. The other queen was pleasantly surprised at the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of his  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  plate. He couldn't finish his eaither but it was really. A lil too  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  for my  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END> , but it was still awesome. We then  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a bottle of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and a sip here and a sip  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and we were all in heaven! Talking to our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  about the Navajo  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  behind the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  who she was trying to hook up with one of us... but we couldn't tell WHO she was trying to hook him up with! One of the queens or me?! Said  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  never made it to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  - and it's just as well... we were in  <START:Food> food <END>  heaven savoring our delights and wishing we had bigger stomachs to take it all in! I'm a big fan of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  now and am VOWING to take several people with me next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ! :)

We live by MOTO so we are kinda stuck when it comes to  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  establishments. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  blows. You can tell it isn't  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and never  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  super. The Mojo &  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  are the only good things. I don't really trust a  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that hides the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  makers in the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> ...stuff probably looks like week  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  shit which it is.

I originally walked in here and thought to myself man I bet this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  of  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  people in the morning..I can see the shamu wearing  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  ladies gathered here in the morning drinking their  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and gabbing like little chatting Cathy dolls about the new pool boy, and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  dudes talking about their tours in Nam and the Korea and the few survivors from the big one  WW II. To say the least I did not see that but I did  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>  it in my mind...suffice to say it was not like that but that was my first vision:)What's good about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is it has plenty of  <START:A_Places> space <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  seems very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and it is  <START:F_FI_Quality> clean <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are delicious with pretty  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Places> portions <END> . Not huge or anything but decent. I did think it was a little pricey considering I could get a bigger better  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  at subway for about $3.00  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in not bad. Run of the mill a little pricey. But would not be opposed to going here again.

A friend of a friend was telling us about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  on Sunday morning, and how awesome their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is.  It sounded awesome, but he warned us the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  is usually an hour and a half long.  Oh well, we went anyway.  Luckily, we were early enough where we didn't have to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  long for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .  When we were leaving, though, the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  was easily an hour long.We started with the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , which come in an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of 14 and were delicious.  Five of us were dining  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , so we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two small  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> , with each one being a half, so we had a nice  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  to try from.  We got the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , the Frisco, Grandma G's, and one more that eludes me now.  All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  with untraditional toppings (Grandma G's had potato on it).  Our entire bill with a few  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  came to under $80.Oh, make sure you sit  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> ... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  and annoy the hell out of our party.  The women in our party also said the  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  temperature kept changing in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  Keep in mind, too, that they don't have a full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , so if you're going  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  hoping to start off with a bloody mary, you're out of luck.

This is about as close to an authentic Japanese izakaya as you'll find anywhere. And I'm talking countrywide.  I've been to several izakaya in Japan over the years and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  just brings me back  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  immediately.   My japanese buddy in San Francisco is jealous of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to give you a little perspective on my claim.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is incredible and you'll find yourself hard pressed to try everything they have to offer as new items come and go all the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  I recommend damn near everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  If something scares you,  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  IT, and you'll be pleasently surprised everytime.  If you do try this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , make sure you get a members card, as you will definately be returning.  For every 5$ you spend you get a stamp.  The initial card saves you 5%, fill it up and you  <START:Offers> save <END>  10%, fill up a second card and you  <START:Offers> save <END>  15%.  This is permanent by the way, you can use it for every visit.  SO GO  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  ALREADY, and I'll most likely see you  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  as I am  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  4-5  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  a week.

Oh sweet baby Jesus, I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Retro  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> , a  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  who does a Robert DeNiro impression, and amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END> . About mid way through my (rare) petite filet the other  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> -I turned to my husband and said, "I want to give this  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  a baby" Because that's how good it is.  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's always a point where I start to get sad that my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  will be gone shortly, so I try to slow down. But it's too hard at the Golden Steer! I don't want to slow down! Nomnomnom.Forget the stupid fancy places in the hotels on the strip, the Golden Steer is the real deal.Go. Now.

I'm no Korean/Hawaiian  <START:Food> food <END>  expert, but this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has lived up to the hype.  Thanks Jade for the recommendation.  Myself and a few coworkers came here today, and not a single one of us wasn't  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> .First off, the  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END>  is bomb here.  I can usually leave out the  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> , but that's only because so many places in Vegas have mediocre  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> .  Not this  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> .  You'll get this as an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , so even if you are not a  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END>  person you have to try it.  Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  (the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ?) sensed my coworker's enthusiasm over the  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> , being the  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END>  fanatic that he is, and complimented us some dumplings.  Off the hook.  The  <START:Food> crust <END>  was kind of  <START:F_FI_Quality> thick <END> , but not greasy at all.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was delicious, great  <START:F_FI_Taste> spice <END>  and herb  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> .  A good sign of things to come...I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  Rock Bi Bim Bap.  Friggin tasty.   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> , super  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> , and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> really nice <END>  Kochujang(?)  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  The Kochujang was slightly sweet but not too sweet, and subtly  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END> .  What set this  <START:Food> dish <END>  apart for me was the high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  for just around $10.00.  Oh, and don't forget the crystallized  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  grains at the bottom. Despite gorging myself on refills of  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> , I couldn't stop eating the Bi Bim Bap until every last  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  grain was gone.  Just a great version of this classic Korean  <START:Food> dish <END> !I also managed to  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  my friend's  <START:F_FoodItem> bulgolgi <END> .  I normally don't like  <START:F_FoodItem> bulgolgi <END>  because it is always tough and overly  <START:F_Ingredients> sauced <END> .  Not this  <START:F_FoodItem> bulgolgi <END> , which is the best I have ever had.  VERY  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , and expertly seasoned.  The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  and of a homemade  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  Just delicious!Again, special thanks to Jade and the other Yelpers.  I don't know why it has taken me so long to try Island Style.  If you don't know if you like Korean  <START:Food> food <END> , this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to try it.  If you don't always feel like Korean  <START:Food> food <END> , this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go when you do.  If you are a Korean  <START:Food> food <END>  snob, give Island Style a try and let me know what you think!

So sad! This used to be one of my fave places. Over the last 10 years I've barely ever make my trip  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  anymore because I am steadily disappointed in the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  if  <START:Food> food <END> !  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  is spoiled or scarce, spring  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  filling probably a week  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> .. So sad because they literally have the best pad thai and  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> squash <END>  on a good  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> . Today I was craving  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  thread noodle so I thought I would given them a chance again.., once again skimped on  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  and yellow (how can you not make  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  everyday?) , and they seem to think  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  means throwing in a shit load of crushed red  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  which adds no  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  or  <START:F_FI_Taste> spice <END>  just stomache irritation,. I'm so sad to say, after over 10 years this my last straw. Sad because  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's so much potential if they took the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .

Easily the best  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Madison.

Let me start by saying this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is REALLY hard to find! Even with my trusty GPS I found myself walking in circles and calling, calling,calling. I've seen many complaints about  <START:Service> service <END>  on here, and while my  <START:Service> service <END>  was not BAD in terms of inattentiveness, it certainly wasn't normal. The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  both came over several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  while we were eating and at one point I just wanted to say, "Um, can we eat? Please? It's great...I assure you. Skidaddle."We had the Wildberry Pancakes with a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> . Everything was good but for what we got, I consider the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  steep. $12.50 for 2 pancakes?? Yes, they were good, but why not 3 with a little more topping? My $4 side of  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  was 3  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  and maybe 1/4 cup of  <START:F_FoodItem> apples <END> . Lame. It's good but I'm not sure if I would return, at least on a  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  when I was really hungry.

I've gone here twice in the 3 days since I moved to Tempe and am extremely grateful to have found this gem (thanks Yelp!).  I eat between 5-10  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  a week and have no doubt that I will be getting several of those from Dilly's.The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , I was a bit put off by the thickness of the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ;  I did not want the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  to overwhelm or disguise the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> /cheeses/ <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  However, the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  (foccacia) was actually quite soft and complemented the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  (the Smokey Mountain) quite well.  Nonetheless, I would warn that if you really are opposed to eating a relatively  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  amount of  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  with your  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , you might prefer something else, or perhaps one of the wraps offered here (though I haven't tried any of those yet).Also, it'd be nice if  <START:F_FI_Healthy> nutritional <END>  information were made available on the website.  One of the main reasons that 80% of my  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  consumption has been at Subway/Cosi/Potbelly is that I know the  <START:F_FI_Healthy> nutritional <END>  content of what I'm eating.  I hope to come here as many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  as possible before the ASU onslaught begins in a few weeks...I hope the lines aren't out the door when classes start...although I suppose I will just eat  <START:Food> lunch <END>  at 2 if that's the case.

With all that hype about this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , I was excited about going  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . But hmm it was just... how can I put it? Meh! Didn't do it for me. I would rather go to Daphne's.

When it comes to  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:Food> lunches <END>  on the westside of town, nothing beats Thai BBQ on Jones. Many a  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  have coworkers and I stopped in for a great  <START:Food> meal <END>  on the  <START:W_Price> cheap <END> . Have tried it a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  of  <START:Food> lunch <END>  which just means the  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are a little  <START:F_FI_Size> larger <END>  and  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  higher but still great Thai  <START:Food> food <END> . Oh... and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is awesome! The only thing I have against this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is their  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  weird to me, but things like  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  or  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  in my sprite are all good. Odd.... Maybe it is just me.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was horrible! I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  200 dollars for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  for two, my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was still mooing! If you are in Vegas and want a real  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse does it right!

Thank you Yolinda for always making me and my guest  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  to your  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .It's always nice to come to this fabulous  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for business meeting with my clients. The  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  is always excellent, and of course, my guest was amazed by the selection of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  you always have to offer.Keep up the good work and always keep the  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END> !!

 <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END> !  We stumbled upon this after attending an event in Vegas and just needed to find a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat.  I usually am so picky about  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  that I won't go to just any  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but we needed to eat.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was very good.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  were tasty.  So much so we bought a bottle of the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> dressing <END>  to take home with us.

Okay, so this was a total hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END> , but GREAT carne asada  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> . I would  perhaps have given them  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 5 stars <END>  if the 3  <START:F_FoodItem> rolled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  had actually first included the gacmole they were suppose to and the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was melted. But the carne asada was very good, almost San Diego-like.  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  put the  <START:Food> food <END>  together in a heart beat but it was 10:30pm.  I have to say, this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is in the memory banks...so close to the airport and the strip (if you have a car).  Just do this,  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a carne asada  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  and ask for extra gac and if you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  do the 5 with the works.  Glad I found this on Yelp and for sure  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END> ..oh and this is take-out only, no  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  really and not a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you want to hang.

Normally love Baja, but this one has been very disappointing.  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like rubber. All but one  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  eating.  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  are a no go, and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was average. My suggestion, don't let this be your first experience a Baja  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , go to another location, they do have good  <START:Food> food <END> !

I have eaten at this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  twice. The first  <START:Food> meal <END>  was memorable and I never forgot it. As a result, I was so excited to go back last week. I had the  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  for an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  which were good but they didn't fit in with that kind of  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . My friend had a  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  that was the favorite of the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> 's but we both found it very strange. It was supposed to be something creole and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  was covered with an unattractive brown  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Odd.We both had a filet mignon. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  mine  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  rare. I couldn't finish the last 15% of it because it was rare. Disgusting. It was fine but not  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  $50. It came with a   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that made it delicious though. Without the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  it would have been a big disappointment.We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a side of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> double baked <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> . That was the best part of the  <START:Food> meal <END> .We each  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . I had the  <START:F_Ingredients> banana <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  pie. It was gorgeous but it was all bananas (which I LOVE) but with little  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END> . It was fine. My friend had the creme brulee and it was delicious. <START:Service> service <END>  was very nice. Overall at $312 I won't be going back simply because it isn't  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  the money.

Best  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  in the Venetian! I am in Vegas for a conference. After realizing the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  at Lavo would take at least an hour (per the bouncer) despite the fact that our group had rented out the  <START:A_Places> space <END> , I checked Yelp and found the VIP  <START:S_Staff> managers <END>  (Jorge) personal number. After a few extremely helpful texts assuring us no cover, a bunch of us headed over  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , tweeting that we were going and for the rest of our group to follow. Michelle at the door was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> really nice <END>  and let us right in. All toll about 50 of us ended up  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and had a great  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> ! The  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are extremely reasonable for this casino ($8 for a rum and  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END> , $8 for  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , etc) and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is hookah for a respectable $25. The DJ was great and had us all dancing. I was blown away by how much the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  went out of their way for our group and truly saved our  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> !

Not much to say about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  ... the  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is hip and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is good but unfortunately, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is pedestrian and while  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a lot of fancy Mexican  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  verbage on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , it's still pretty straight forward typical Americanized-Mexican fare.   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END> , tamales, combo  <START:S_Cutlery> plate. <END>  etc.  I can get this kind of  <START:Food> food <END>  in my suburban home town that  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  better and  <START:W_Price> cost. <END>  a lot less.  Even the highly-rated  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> -side  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  was just ok ...  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's just too much stuff in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  Could all of this be smoothed over by a nice  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END> ?  Well, I will never know because mine was too sweet.  Overall, a disappointment.

I've been to the House of Blues for a few concerts now, and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are plenty of other venues that offer a better sound  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> , especially in Las Vegas. If you have the opportunity to see a band at another venue, I  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>  it. The sound  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is awful, so  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  will be a very low chance you'll understand anything coming out of the singers mouth. It ends up being just a muffle that fades into the rest of the band.

The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is great and just shy of being too hip. Waitstaff was super  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> --felt like I was eating at a friend's house, but guess that's the point.Limoncello and  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were great. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  suggested we get the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  one over  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END> . You should try it.Didn't try the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . We'll be back.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has definitely improved. I remember the early days of soggy crusts,  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , subpar  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  and heartburn.  This is certainly no longer the case.The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was super jammed around 6pm on a Thursday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> .  It was actually kind of exciting!  All the  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  in back were having a good ol'  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , and the gals up front taking the  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  were visibly stressed, but doing a great job.  We ended up creating our own  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .  We kept it simple, and just added  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> .  It's everyone's new favorite... in fact, I've been  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  the same combination at other  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  places, but it's not nearly as  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>  as Mamma Mia's version.  They have a great selection to build your own, however I'm sure that all their offerings are a hit as evidenced by the long  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  of hungry  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  lovers going out the door.

I've been to  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  at other casinos, but this is the best by far! Lots of  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:Food> seafood <END> , great carving stations, however I was not a fan of the way the prime rib was seasoned, and great  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> !

At first I was disappointed with Padre's  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  I usually get  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> , and they only had soft  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> .  But then I ventured out and got this amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  that came with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  Really glad I tried it.I was also pleased to see that they had Sol  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  It is my favorite Mexican cerveza, and I usually can't find it in  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .

Great  <START:Food> food <END> ! Best  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  I've ever had. Get the nachos, you won't be disappointed! 10x better than Roberto's!

Awesome  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> ! Their microbrewed  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  are a mere $2 a pint from 3-6pm Monday through Friday (excluding holidays and Monday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  Football.) They also have $2 well  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  as well as a great selection of  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  for $4.50. I had an IPA and a Santa Klaas Holiday Ale which was specially brewed for the holiday season. This was a very dark ale that is made with  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cocoa <END>  nibs. It was a delicious and different  <START:F_FI_Taste> bittersweet <END>  ale with  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  overtones. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and fantastic!We were only  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  this trip but will definitely return for more awesome  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and to try some of the  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END> !

Think New Jersey  <START:Food> diner <END>  size  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , lots and lots of  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  covering most major  <START:Food> food <END>  groupings.  I had an LTO special called drunken  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  which had a pleasant  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>  red  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and was served over potato cakes.   Very generous  <START:F_FI_Size> in size <END>  and I enjoyed it.  We also tried the rib's which turned out to be very decent considering it is a chain  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with a broad  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was very good and the store had a good sized  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>  eating area.  Would certainly go again if in the area.

You know how sometimes a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has such an impact on you that you start writing a review in your head as soon as you put something in your mouth? That happened and zero stars should be a thing.I decided to give this  <START:Food> buffet <END>  a chance since a client had booked rooms for my coworker and I at Excalibur, and after getting up 6am for the flight and working until 7pm that  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> , we were both exhausted and didn't want to go very far for  <START:Food> food <END> . Big mistake. No matter how tired or hungry you think you are, you are NOT desperate enough to eat here. I would have preferred walking back to LA.The selection was awful, all the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was dry, the  <START:Food> seafood <END>  looked sketchy enough that I was too scared of potential  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Healthy> poisoning <END>  to try anything, and a lot of items at the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  were browning. All I ended up eating was a couple  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , one  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of potato gratin, and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Yes, this is  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>  (only $22) but it's not even  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  that. I wish I'd just gone hungry.

Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  today. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is next to  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  N juicy. Not big, but not too crowded at  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is very simple just  <START:S_Menu> one page <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  soon  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END> , my friend had dolsot bibimbap special. Both of us enjoyed our  <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END>  is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  inside is also  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  is very fast too.

We went at around 5:30 on a  Tuesday  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END>  and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was fairly busy.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  drop  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was delicious, and the highlight of the  <START:Food> meal <END> .  The only other two  <START:Food> dishes <END>  that were  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  enough were the Walnut  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> steamed <END>  clams.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were a lot of high value items at the  <START:Food> buffet <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> crab legs <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and the like, but most of it was  <START:F_FI_Quality> dried out <END>  and not as tasty as it looked.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a wide selection ans some interesting  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> , like clams smothered in cheddar  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  I guess this is Arizona, and I should not have been surprised that next to the sweet and sour  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a tub of  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was also obligatory Chinese  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .  I don't eat any of these picky eater accommodation  <START:Food> foods <END> , so cannot comment on their  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . They had a wide  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END> , too, including a  <START:F_FoodItem> sundae <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  i had the green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  and it was okay,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were a couple of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  crystals in it. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was  <START:W_Price> more expensive <END>  than I thought it would be.  I think the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  range should be adjusted to Moderate $$. I did not try the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  preparing it as we watched and it looked good.

Awesome  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are a lot better than most places,  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are good too... well definitely be stopping in when in that area...  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> 

I've been here twice now for the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  and the second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I even brought a friend who was a foodie and both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  it was great. They have a great selection of dips on the  <START:Food> buffet <END> , a few  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and many  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>   <START:Food> entrees <END>  to choose from. I recommend taking a little bit of everything and if you follow my rule, you won't be disappointed. Everything is absolutely delicious and you'll have fun guessing the spices in the various  <START:Food> dishes <END> . If you're in the mood for some tasty middle eastern  <START:Food> food <END> , I would really recommend it. It's a little short on  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> , but with  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  like that, who's looking anywhere but their plate?

Went to Flo's  <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END> , we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  and sour  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , which was very sour & not  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  at all; crunchy  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> , which was ok, one of the highlights of the  <START:Food> meal <END> ;  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  chow mein, which was tasteless;  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was ok, nothing special; and moo shu  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , which wasn't good. The majority of the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was tasteless.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were 5 of us in total, and we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $50 plus tip.

Gag  <START:Worthiness> worthy <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> facilities <END> ; Sketchy business practices!  This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  deserves 0 stars. I was in Las Vegas on a business trip and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .  It was dripping with so much  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END>  that even 5 napkins would not sop it up. I returned the entire slice  <START:F_FI_Quality> uneaten <END>  and requested my money back. The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  at the register refused and told me to come back at  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and ask for Pete.  I returned later and the  <START:S_Staff> female <END>  " <START:S_Staff> manager <END> " told me Pete wasn't  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and they don't give refunds.  After ignoring me for 10 minutes she realized I wasn't going away so she called Pete on the phone. He said he would have to mail me a check  for the purchase  <START:W_Price> price <END>  of the slice. Uh, the slice was $3 and, as you probably guessed, I never received the check. In addition to the gross  <START:Food> food <END> , I made the mistake of entering the  <START:A_Plc_RestRoom> restroom <END>  and the stench of urine and fllth almost knocked me unconscious! Avoid this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  under all circumstances!!

Excellent  <START:Food> food <END> ! I was here for a  <START:Food> lunch <END>  meeting and was  <START:Service> treated <END>  but I believe for the 3 of us the bill came out to $40 if you're trying to estimate cost. Note we were here on a Monday and they close at 4:00  <START:S_OpenHours> pm <END>  on Monday's.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was ample  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  inside, but I can see it hard to grab a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  during the  <START:Food> lunch <END>  rush. They have your standard mexican  <START:Food> dishes <END> . I was craving some  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Al Pastor Taco combo with  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> . I was hardly able to finish but it was too good to leave left overs. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>  too. Interestingly enough they were lacking  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  options and brought out a small condiment cup of Tapatio when I asked for some. Everyone else seemed to tear up their  <START:Food> food <END>  as well and seemed satisfied. Reason for the  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END>  then? It's not the best mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  I've had, so I have to  <START:Offers> save <END>  the  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 5 stars <END>  for my favorite places, but for a lot of people this is a 5 star  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is awesome! I never have been a fan of chinese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , other than Panda Express, but this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great. I'd recommend the sweet n sour  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  :) And the best part is, they  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END> !

I noticed a bunch of Pho places on Spring during my trip to Vegas this past weekend.Having partied hardy the  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  before, our group decided Pho was definitely in  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .Maybe I'm spoiled a bit because I've had the best Pho in San Jose and Westminster... and so my Pho standards are pretty high.I felt it was an okay  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  at first glance:  <START:F_FI_Quality> clean <END> , lots of Vietnamese locals, and spacious.The pho was really average. The  <START:Food> broth <END>  lacked body and substance, and could have possibly been adulterated with some Swanson's  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> broth <END> . I hate that. The  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  were okay, but the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was TOTALLY skimpy in the  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  in Pho Dac Biet, I got no such  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  in my bowl and no tripe either =(I also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  some Vietnamese  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Sua Da) and it wasn't strong enough. They skimped on the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  grounds. I like places that prepare the french press in front of you instead of going to the back and giving you pre-stirred  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , but they shafted me on the strength. It  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:F_Drinks> watered <END>  down.I'd probably never come back unless it were like the AM and I was desperately wasted.The  <START:Service> service <END>  kind of sucked too. We were all hungover and needed  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . We had to ask 100x  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  for refills!This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  kind of reminds of the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and even appearance of Lee's Noodle House in San Jose off of Tully Rd.... If you're from San Jose, you know what I'm talking about - this is Lee's Noodle House twin brother in Vegas.

Second  <START:Food> buffet <END>  stop in my 5  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  stay.The highlight of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  had to be the fire alarm that rang out in the middle of our  <START:Food> lunch <END> . Heh, dunno what happened  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .All that aside, the  <START:Food> food <END>  itself was below average to average. Probably the only thing I liked was the Har Gow. The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  was loathful; leaving it out in the open for what seemed like for hours (the colours look way off). I didn't bother touching it, as who knows what kind of  <START:F_FI_Healthy> bacteria <END>  has grown in those things...

One of my favorite Tempe spots, Forefathers really instilled in me a love for the Philly  <START:F_FoodItem> cheesesteak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . When visiting, I always  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the 2nd  <START:F_FoodItem> cheesesteak <END>  option with white American  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , and either a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> french   fries   <END>  or their equally excellent  <START:F_Appetizer> sweet   potato   fries <END>  <END>  <END> . For those wanting to manage their  <START:A_Places> portions <END> , their  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  also come in smaller sizes. After placing your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , be sure to go to the small  <START:A_Furniture> refrigerator <END>  across from the  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  machine and get a side of their sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  to accompany your  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has great  <START:Food> food <END> , and along with it a comfortable, casual dining  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> . It also has  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  ownership and  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . It's been a while since I lived in Phoenix, but whenever I return and come to Forefathers,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are people working here who remember me and  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  me back. If you check out Forefathers, I am sure you'll want to come back again.

Interesting reading other reviews complaining about the  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> rude <END>   <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  too. It is the main reason I will never put my foot in Cafepino again, apart from the fact that it is  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END> . I much prefer to go to AMC  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>  Ridge and have  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  half  <START:W_Price> price <END>  during  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>  at the Yard House, where the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  is  <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END>  and cares about his customers.Eight of us went to movies and had  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at Cafepino last month. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was okay but I had to cancel  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  because it took so long to arrive and our movie was starting in a few minutes. We were  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  long before the movie started to have enough  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to eat. When we wanted to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  separately because everyone didn't have cash, the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  scoffed at us and basically said he couldn't accommodate us, only one person had to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END> . We were all shocked at how  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> rude <END>  he was and decided to move our once-a-month movie  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  to a different location. Good job in loosing eight customers in one fell swoop. Bon chance!

Ever since I came here the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went to Vegas, I've been DYING to come back.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is so good!  I thought we just got lucky the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we came, but as it turns out, everything we've tried on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  thus far is DELICIOUS. <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is classy and cool.  It's a nice location within the Palazzo hotel with lots of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was also good, as my  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  glass was always full despite being very  <START:S_Del_Time> busy. <END> on a Friday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  at midnight.We got:MOQUECA MISTA -  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> squid <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_Drinks> milk <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> roasted cashew <END> , dende oil, chimichurri  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  - $29 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushisamba-las-vegas?select=T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uA#T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uAThis thing is the BEST EVER.   <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>  Thai-style  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  (hence  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_Drinks> milk <END> ) with the delicate  <START:Food> seafood <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  in with bits of crushed cashews, giving the  <START:Food> dish <END>  great  <START:Food> texture <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was served within the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  mixture as shown; the  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> soaked <END>  up all the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , making every  <START:F_FoodItem> morsel <END>  DIVINE.  I thought after a while the  <START:Food> dish <END>  would get too rich-tasting, but somehow I kept gobbling and gobbling until the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate. <END> was empty!EL TOPO  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  - salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf,  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  melted mozzerella,  <START:F_FI_Taste>     crisp <END> . <END>  <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  - $15 (forgot to take a pic; too excited about the moqueca mista)Very unique   roll   with interesting  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  and textures = Delicious! <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  TERIYAKI - Samba Style organic  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , aji amarillo, purple potato mash,  <START:F_FI_Taste>     crisp <END> . <END>  <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  - $26 (again forgot to take a pic...)When I saw the huge   price   tag I thought "WTF?!", especially for a seemingly simple  <START:S_Cutlery> plate. <END> as  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  teriyaki (my friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  this one so I had no control).  BUTTT I'll have to say that it was probably the best teriyaki  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  I've ever had in my life!  Super juicy fillets of teriyaki  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , pan  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  (I think) to a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END> .  The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was perfect; not too saucy, not too dry, and definitely not overpowering to the  <START:Food> dish <END> .As with all finer dining  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , especially on the Las Vegas Strip, I did think the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were a little inflated.  Hence the lack of that final star.  However, probably one of my favorite places to eat while in Vegas.  I'll definitely hit it up again on future trips.  They have a good  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>  too (both early  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END>  and late  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> ), so I'll have to take advantage of that next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ! :)

Just tried Create  <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END>  on a date with the hubby.  Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to build your own  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> custard <END>  sundaes!  Too many  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  for me, so I opted for the pre-designed option:  The Abstract  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  ( <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END> ) made Renaisance-style (provolone,  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> , terriyaki  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ) on a Hawaiian  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  with  <START:F_Appetizer> sweet   potato   fries <END>  <END>  <END> .  Yum!  Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'd like to try the Portobello  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ...and opt for a wheat  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  and maybe get a little more  <START:Food> creative <END>  with toppings, but the combinations are endless...The options for the  <START:F_Dessert> custard <END>  is just as abundant!  Candy, nuts,  <START:F_FoodItem> berries <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> ...and of course the pre-set combos.  I tried the Berriesoho  <START:F_FoodItem> sundae <END>  in a  <START:F_Dessert> cone <END>  <START:F_FoodItem> ...strawberries <END> , blueberries, blackberries, whipped  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END> , and  <START:F_Ingredients> vanilla <END>   <START:F_Dessert> custard <END> .  I think it was the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  someone asked for a  <START:F_FoodItem> sundae <END>  in a  <START:F_Dessert> cone <END> , but it worked.  The only problem was that it was melting faster than I could eat it, but still very yum!Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for ppl who like  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  and want to be  <START:Food> creative <END> .  The people who work  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:A_Places> kept   clean   <END> .  It's a little too pricey for me to be a " <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END> "  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat, but I will definitely go back again.

I cannot explain how much I love the  <START:Food> food <END>  here, especially the Fungi  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . to.die.for. They have a great  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  from 3-6 and all  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  Sunday, which I appreciate.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  is hit and miss.  If only they could be more consistent with the  <START:Service> service <END> , this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  would knock it out of the  <START:A_Places> park <END> .

Very slow and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> unresponsive <END>   <START:Service> service <END> , at one point the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  didn't stop by for 20 minutes.   The  <START:Food> food <END>  took over 45 minutes and was cold when it was served.  $300  <START:Food> meal <END>  for 4 people, better to spend your money elsewhere.  Only good point was the key  <START:F_FoodItem> lime pie <END> .

My partner and I went to Eddie's House prior to her  <START:A_Decor> art <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  opening at a nearby gallery.  We planned on Eddie's as a start to a very special  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END> .  We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  and it took our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  7 minutes to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  us and ask us if we would like  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> .  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  another 10 minutes for them to arrive.  When he brought them he made no mention of the long  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  to share and then a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  platter to share as our  <START:Food> main course <END> .  He brought everything out at once which was not what we asked for.  We ate our  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and asked for the bill upon completion as we were leaving to get to the  <START:A_Decor> art <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> .  We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> ...and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> .  I went inside to try to find him with no luck.  20 minutes later he brought the bill out.   The  <START:Food> food <END>  was average and over  <START:W_Price> priced <END> .  We were charged for a small  <START:Food> dish <END>  of extra pita  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  to supplement the original small serving that arrived with the hummus.  All in all it was a disappointing experience due primarily to the dismissive behavior by our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> .  I called Eddie's House the next  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  to share my feedback and got Eddie on the phone.   I started telling him about my experience and he he  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> acted <END>  like I was interrupting him.    He asked if he could call me right back and confirmed my phone number with me.  He never called back.  I will never return to Eddie's House after this poor example of customer  <START:Service> service <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are too many other  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Scottsdale to dine in who  <START:Service> treat <END>  customers like they are  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  the effort to be courteous.

Went with  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and thought  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  a bit like  <START:Restaurant> cafeteria <END>   <START:Food> food <END> . Overall, my  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  loved it. I was just not too "Krazy" about it.

To be hnonest, I have only eaten here a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , but I ALWAYS use them for  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> catering <END> . Today was no different. Perfect in every way. Thank you Mitch( <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ) for all of your hard work.  Great  <START:Service> service <END> , thank you!

What a great  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>  find! I live just around the corner and was so exited to find a new  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go out to eat! The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has a great  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  with an  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  Chevy Right in the center. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  could not be any more  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  either! When it comes to the  <START:Food> food <END> , you can't go wrong! The  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is to die for, and I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to come for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> berry <END>  granola pancakes. I give it an A++!

the quick and dirty - on a great placeAtmosphere:  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Vasco Da Gama (henceforth referred to as CVDG) has been around for a while.  A  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  that serves  <START:Food> food <END> , it's offend crowded with couples and  <START:S_Del_Time> busy. <END> working professionals - its a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to see and be seen and ironically one can even hide away here! (go to the back!) <START:Food> food <END> : Tunal  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ?! Yes please - a specialty of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , CVDG surges paninis,  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  that are both temptingly good and filling.  Never had a bad  <START:Food> meal <END>  here. <START:Service> service <END> : since the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  can be quite crowded, be prepared to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  a little bit to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> .   <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  are made in person at the counter, and  <START:Food> food <END>  is delivered to you once its ready.  Minimal  <START:Service> service <END> , but always pleasant and courteous.Pop in for a bit during the work  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  but my favourite  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to visit is during the early hours of Sat / Sun - people are a lot more relaxed and  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a general sense of easy about the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  as people are inclined to be a lot more mellow.  Summer  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  even bring a few  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  for some open  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  render-vousYou should go :)

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is horrible, I wouldn't feed this to my dog. It is however tasty and greasy if you haven't a  palate.

This is such a cozy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ! I had no idea it was right around the corner for me. 4 weeks into going Vegan and I was starting to feel like my only option at any  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  or  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  was  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  topped with  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> . Not so at Sunrise  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ! I'm finding lots of other places offer items as well, but  <START:S_Menu> menus <END>  need to be asked for.The  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  was delicious, and just as beautiful to boot! The  <START:Food> food <END>  was great. I had the Alien  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , and my boyfriend had the nomnom  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> . Both made vegan. No complaints from either of us!  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are fair. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is adorable and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> ! Support local, and keep this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  alive!!

Mmmm I love Buffalo Grill!! If ever I am feeling in a serious need for some  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , this is always my first and last port of call as it always does the trick. Situated just around the corner from the main University campus, George Square, Buffalo Grill is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for students to go for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  or  <START:Food> dinner <END> . I completely and utterly adore Buffalo Grill's  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  always ask you how well you want your  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> , as it always comes out exactly how you have asked it to be done. I tend to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  their Diablo  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , which comes with sour  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and jalapenos  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  so it is pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  but amazing. The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  come in two different sizes, and I always  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the smaller version as that fills me up and  <START:W_Price> cost. <END>  about £5 and the bigger size  <START:W_Price> cost. <END>  about £7. The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  come with  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and, my favourite,  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END> ! Buffalo Grill also serves a huge  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of different Scottish  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  which  <START:W_Price> cost. <END> no more than £10 - what a bargain! But the Buffalo Grill is not just a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  eaters, as they have a main  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  which offers a good selection of  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  too such as  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> 's and  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  Benedict. A  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END>  are also available including  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pecan <END>  pie which is amazing. Buffalo Grill also allow you to bring your own booze which is a much  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END>  option than buying  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  in a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . I completely adore this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and cannot recommend it more highly - GO!!

Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  in the UK has been grievously disappointing, both in  <START:W_Price> price <END>  and representation.  Gone are the days when $4 can score me a half-pounder cabaza/lengua  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> .Tex Mex was the last I expected this far up north.  Scotland rocks.Let's do this bullet-point style:Margaritas - decent tequila content and thoroughly slushed.  Nothing more annoying that semi-icy concoctions that don't travel up straws well.Much respect for carrying Dos Equis, Corona, Sol, Modelo and that obscure little label Pacifico.Tequila - they carry the good stuff; these  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  have done their homework.  Gun for the Anejos.  Don Julio Gold Anejo was my pick.Floutas - more like giant taquitos, the corn tostada-wrapped  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is deep  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  to crunchy perfection.  Topped off with  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , sour  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  and guac it's what I'd expect to see in higher-end Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in LA or San Diego.Carnitas - the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was served in cubes and was much too salty, unfortunately. <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  - covered in a healthy layer of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  to be called such, it's an accurate enough representation of what my Mexican friends' moms would make at home. Approved.

I really wish that I lived closer to one of the Crackers  <START:A_LocatedArea> locations <END> , because their  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  rocks! After a field trip to IKEA with my mom and sister we decided to grab a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat, I knew that Crackers had recently opened nearby, so we stopped by. The inside is very cute, feels like you are in someones country home. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has a huge  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END> . On weekends, they serve  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  all  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> ! I got the Carnitas  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  skillet, and let me just say, they seriously have some of the best carnitas in town, no joke! The  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was so  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> ; covered with jack  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  on a bed of  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> , heaven! My sister got the BLT, and they were not skimpy on the  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> ! I have had some of their  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END>  before, and let's just say, the  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  & Artichoke is like heaven in a bowl! So rich, and  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END> , it is like eating dip without the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> ! They are only open until 2:00, but it is great spot to grab a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  or  <START:Food> lunch <END> !

One of the better  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  places on this side of town, good selection, nice  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , not too busy

I do enjoy the  <START:Food> food <END>  here . Finding good island  <START:Food> food <END>  like how you would get in Hawaii is state find in Las Vegas. My favorites are the Kalbi,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and the weekly specials. My wife insists we come every Tuesday for the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> . All  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are ample  <START:A_Places> portions <END> . Most like you will have  <START:Food> leftovers <END>  for the  <START:A_Furniture> fridge <END>  tomorrow. The Chantilly vale is to for. The live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on the selected weekend is a  <START:Service> treat <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  here is always on point. Keep up the great work it's like you on an island in the middle of the  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END> .

Eh, but better airport  <START:Food> food <END>  then usual

If I HAD to eat one  <START:Food> buffet <END>  every  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  this would be the one I would pick..The long lines are a minus,but that shows others  [mostly locals] also feel as I do.

 <START:Service> service <END>  was slow and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was horrible!!!! With 4 exclamation points. We went through the drive-thru and the handwritten sign says pull forward to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , so we did. The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  didn't come to the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>  for 7 minutes. Then he asks us to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  another couple of minutes to take our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . At that point we should have left. But I was curious as to see what the rave was all about on the Travel Channel. When we finally get our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  taken. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a Pastrami  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . Not only was the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  long the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to get our  <START:Food> food <END>  was even longer. Total  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  25 minutes, no I'm not joking.As any fast  <START:Food> food <END>  eating American would do we pulled out the  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and took a few out while we were driving away. Yes they were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  as expected. But they were so salty and hardly any  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . We were expecting minced  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  and to our surprise it was only  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  salt with more salt - YUCK.The pastrami was very thinly sliced but was very fatty. Not typical of "LA Style Pastrami" as advertised. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  was hard and not  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> . Could it get any worse - YES, the pickle was not put in a separate wrapper as I asked, so the pickle  <START:F_Drinks> juice <END>  made the inside  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  soggy. I do not like  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END>  on my  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> . The portion of pastrami was very skimpy. IMO - This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is not  <START:Worthiness> worthy <END>  of any publicity on national TV. It is expensive and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is CRAP. If you are in Los Angeles got to the Hat, you will not be disappointed!

If you go to Happys , you become part of the Happy's  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> ! Great  <START:S_Menu> variety <END> , simple good  <START:Food> food <END>  with generous  <START:A_Places> portions <END> ! We love Leo, Donna and the entire crew. Try it you will love it!

Pros: Great  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , especially for AYCE!!  Whoever posted that their  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are mostly  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , are completely Wrong!  In comparison to other AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  places, they have  <START:F_FI_Size> very little <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> .  Great big  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , etc.  Maybe at one point they did mostly  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , but not since Nov 2011.  Nice  <START:S_Staff> servers <END> .  <START:Food> lunch <END>  AYCE was approx. $20/person Cons: It was super super  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  I had to go  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  a couple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  to cool down.  They must have had the  <START:A_Furniture> heater <END>  cranked up. Finally told them about the  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  temp and they were kind and turned it down (still a little  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END> ).  Also, the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were taking FOREVER to come out.  That was the longest  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  I had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for.  They were good and fancy (seemed to be made w/extra love), but if you are in a hurry, I would sit at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> !  Not a very  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  Not really good for big groups. Ok  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> -nothing fancy.  Overall, good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and would recommend it and would go back...prob sit at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ! :P

Thank goodness for good company! Though the  <START:Service> service <END>  was great... the rest was.. not so much. First strike: the filthiest  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  glass I have ever seen. And I normally don't  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  attention to such things.. good thing I did!! Secondly, the  <START:F_Ingredients> ginger <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> dressing <END>  was quite odd. Not what Im used to, and very 'mayonaise-y' ( <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END> ).  And while the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were quite good, nothing stood out as fantastic about them. The  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>  flakes on one of our  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were definitely stale.  (unless chewy  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>  flakes are the new thing...?) next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm in the Queen City, I will skip Room 112. Sorry (as for the filthy  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  glass, it was replaced even after the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  was poured in... the bottle was replaced as well).

The  <START:Food> food <END>  is just amazing! A  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is about $6 then you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  around $1 for whatever you want to add to the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> , pickle..). $3 for  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and you have an option of  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END> ! (I recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  one).$6 for poutines! (which are really good!) <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are $2-$3. I usually take a  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END>  and for $1 more, I get a  <START:F_FI_Size> scoops <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> vanilla <END>  icecream added to it! (just amazing)!

I have been to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for 3  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  now... Their  <START:Service> service <END>  sucks...  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  is worst... I had  <START:F_Ingredients> papaya <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and I had  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Healthy> poisoning <END>  and I threw up on my way back to work.... I am not going back again

Great hidden gem in  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  Town Scottsdale!  We had an Amazon deal to use and decided to stop in for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with our furry friend this weekend.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was so nice and  <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END>  to us and our dog on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> .  We tried a pretzel with mustard,  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  and mozzarella  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and a homemade prickly pear  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>   <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> .  Everything was  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and delicious and a perfect  <START:Food> lunch <END> !   <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END> !

Cherries has the potential to be a decent  <START:Food> diner <END>  in Market Square, but they don't quite  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END> . I stopped here for a late  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  and grabbed a  <START:A_Furniture> stool <END>  at the counter. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was packed, which isn't saying much when the max capacity is like 30.Anyway, it took awhile to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , even just to get a cup of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> . It seemed like they had enough  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , but what they were all doing, I'm not sure. So I finally got my over-easy  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> yolks <END>  already broken),  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  (crunch, crunch) and  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  (eh). Oh, the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>  was good. I was so hungry, I didn't even care at that point.So, I finished the  <START:Food> meal <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> ,  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> ,  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for my check. Thankfully, it was fairly inexpensive. I was happy to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  and leave quickly to find a real cup of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  somewhere else.

One star for the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  besides that the  <START:Food> food <END>  was really bad I got the grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  sliders and they were just plain gross. The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was nasty and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like it was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  in  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> . Harsh I know.

Very good Mexican  <START:F_FI_Taste> spice <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> , the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are a little on the high side but  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  it when you get  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  in all the  <START:Food> food <END> !

I've been to Mundo twice now, and  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>  it.  It is a  <START:F_FI_Price> bit pricey <END> , but well  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  it.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  was not great, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was fantastic.  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END> , which was amazing.  It came with  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  and was quite  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END> , which I like.  When it arrived it was still wrapped in the paper pouch in which it was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> , so that was a bit of a mess.  I get it...  It keeps it  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  very  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  when you open it yourself.  But then I had this big  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of soggy parchment on my plate.  I had to ask a  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  to take it away.  Otherwise, the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and  <START:Food> texture <END>  were superb.  Despite the  <START:A_Env_Type> messiness <END> , it's a  <START:Food> dish <END>  well  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END> .

What a GREAT experience!   <START:Food> dinner <END>  was excellence and the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were strong.  The  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  is loud but you shouldn't be going here for a quite  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great for the beginning to your  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  out.  I recommend any of the  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  and the  <START:Food> seafood <END>  platter.

SOOOOOO much fun!!!! We had a couch under the awning across from the Dj Booth and right next to the  <START:A_Entertainment> gambling <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> !!! Perfect since we were  <START:A_Entertainment> gambling <END>  and Will I am was Dj'ing. We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  next to two  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  of peeps in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  30's-40's and we all had a blast!!! This is not Rehab!!  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was serious parting going on, including some slipping and sliding. The  <START:A_Decor> poles <END>  in the center of the pool brought out the inner  <START:S_Staff> stripper <END>  in a lot of girls who some how managed to have heels on up  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ??? The  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were awesome and our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> 's Valerie and Will were so  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> !!  We did not meet the  minimum for our bed and she was able to quickly calculate the amount of shots required to meet our quota. again SO MUCH FUN!! I will definitely go back, you should too...unless your under 25 : )

Came on a monday afternoon for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . and it was delicious! I've only had tapas twice and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was not a thing we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  that was not full of  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and savored each and every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . We oredered:Tuna  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> : Sweet with a little kick. loved the different  <START:Food> testures <END>  of this dishceviche of  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> : i didnt eat it, cause im not a fan of the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> . but my friends loved itstuffed  <START:F_FoodItem> dates <END> : Hands down my fave  <START:Food> dish <END>  of the afternoon. it was sweet and savory and tongasmic.  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> dates <END>  and a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> nut <END>  in the center. How can you not love?? <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Empanadas: the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  one was great and didnt feel like you were eating  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  wrapped in  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  dough. it was smooth and great  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was good but the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  was my faveCamarones a la diabla: i didnt eat  the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  cause im not a fan of the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , but the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that came with  it was  superb! we requested more  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and i lathered it up with the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and inhaled it! Albondigas: i love  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  but i had better. the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was a bit tough and not as succulant as  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  should be. but it had delicious  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . just the  <START:Food> texture <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  turned me offLamb skewers:   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was a bit dry but non the less delicious! must eat with the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END> , the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>   all together!Filet mignon sliders: yum yum yum!def will come back when im back in vegas!

My wife and I both lived in Thailand for many years and so we enjoy trying out Thai places in the Valley. We were not disappointed with Thai  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> . Pleasant  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  (just about the only Thai  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I've been to with tablecloths. This could be a mistake since the usual way to eat Thai  <START:Food> food <END>  -- passing around and sharing several  <START:Food> dishes <END>  -- can get messy). We shared larb gai ( <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  minced  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> mint <END>  and other things) and green  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> . We can recommend both, and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was enough so we could bring some home. We had both  <START:Food> dishes <END>  at " <START:F_FI_Taste> spice <END>  10," and it was quite  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END> , the way we like it. If you prefer it milder just get a lower number.

well this one beats the other one in Chandler they have a few more trays and a nicer  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . Everything I ate was real good from the  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>  clam chowder to the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> .This is my new favorite Chinese  <START:Food> buffet <END>  in Arizona.A couple of things wrong were,my cake was still  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frozen <END>  and all the trays were not out at opening. They are new with new  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  so I hope they iron out these problems quickly other than that it was a great  <START:Food> buffet <END>  experience and I am going to put them on my top ten list for  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END> .

Twist continues to impress.  Contemporary dining  <START:A_Places> space <END>  with illuminated glass globes suspended throughout, outstanding  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  of the Strip,  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  and efficient  <START:Service> service <END> , and incredible  <START:Food> food <END> .  What more can you ask for?Straight to the  <START:Food> food <END> .  The Hudson Valley foie. Presented two ways.  Poached (sous-vide) served with a horseradish emulsion, tart sauerkraut and smoky Morteau  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END> .  A great savory balance between earthy, tart, smoky  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  all cutting the richness of the foie.  Second, "nuggets" of a foie terrine "glazed" with Glenmorangie dusted with sweet and  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  gingerbread power and hazelnuts.  The smoky undertones of the single malt accentuates the mineral, livery  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of the foie.  Delish.  Apple  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  on the side; perfect.The Dover sole &  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>  is hard to top.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>  scented  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  ("glazed" with  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>  cider) is brought to life by an earthy morel  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  and vegetal  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  of turnips,  <START:F_FoodItem> coriander <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> .  The addition of  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>  adds sweetness and a nice oceanic  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> .  Complex yet refreshing  <START:Food> dish <END> .The list of great  <START:Food> dishes <END>  goes on and on.  The degustation  <START:S_Menu> menus <END>  are the best way to sample Twist.   <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are scaled down so no risk of over eating (unless you have the six course grand  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END> ).  Beautiful and delicious; just remember, you've been warned.  Note for  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  lovers:  Twist offers the best  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  Japanese A5 Wagyu  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  in Vegas.  Offered as a New York  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ;  10 ounces, $198.   Of course, eating this would be BORING.Multiple revisits, always a twist!

I love the  <START:Food> food <END>  here, is it better than In n Out?  Not so sure.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  are definitely  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and delish.  I got a  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and holy moly was it alot of  <START:Food> food <END> !  I think the little  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  would have been fine and I could have easily split one  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  with my two boys.  They fill up the cup of  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , which is a good size and then dump more into the bag!  I took off one half of a star because of the  <START:W_Price> price <END> , I thought it was pretty pricey for fast  <START:Food> food <END> .  I also took off one quarter of a star for the loudness, I couldn't even hear myself think in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  because the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was so loud.  They lose another quarter of a star because they do not offer kids  <START:Food> meals <END> .  Now that I know portion size though, I can  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  more appropriately because we had a bunch of  <START:Food> food <END>  leftover on our first visit here.  All of the  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  are super nice and quick so all around I really like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and would return.

After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant to try MM. However,  <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END>  was my friends birthday so we all met here for  <START:Food> dinner <END> ...The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is very "chain like", not really what I was expecting(yes, I do know it's a chain).Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Ashley, was very nice, and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> . She didn't let any of our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  go with out refills, and she split our  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> 's check for us with out us even having to ask!The  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good. We had the drunken fun  <START:S_Staff> guy <END> (?)  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  and the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Both were good, not amazing, but good. Everything  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  a little 'processed' or maybe just not very  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> . The  <START:Food> crust <END>  was good and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END> , but had an almost  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> microwaved <END>   <START:Food> texture <END>  to it, like it was  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> ...I might give them another try, I just don't know if it's really the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for me...

This is a good Hawaiian grill! The macaroni  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  is the best around. Support your local businesses people! This is the best  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I've been to in this area.

I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  until I had a few visits to review Cartel.Firs and foremost, great  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> . I have  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  lattes, chai, dirty chai, and the cold brew (toddy). All have been delicious. The ratio with the chai/ <START:F_Drinks> milk <END>  is pretty spot on and the cold brew is fantastic. I would say the cold brew is probably my go to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  from now on, though the dirty chai is delicious. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  has always been very nice and helpful.  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  seem to be a tinsy bit high but the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is tasty so I keep going back. The shop is a littttle pretentious but not enough to deter me.Give it a shot, you'll love the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> .

Nami is hands down my absolute favorite  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  establishment in all of PhoenixHere are a couple of words to describe Nami's tsoynami...YummyDeliciousWonderfulHeaven in a cupThe perfect dessertThe tsoynami's are  <START:F_FI_Quality> home made <END>  vegan soy  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  which you can choose several different topping options with... <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are several  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  as well as their own creations... They are all extremely delicious but I think my top 3 are as follows...1- Dough Boychocolate  <START:F_FoodItem> chip <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cookie <END>  dough and organic chocolate2-NO's 'n' Mintnewman's  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  O's,  <START:F_Ingredients> mint <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> , organic chocolate3- Clunky Monkey (GF) <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> banana <END> , organic  <START:F_FoodItem> pecans <END> , organic chocolateThe customer  <START:Service> service <END>  at Nami is wonderful as each  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  is very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and knowledgable of the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  but they also provide very helpful tips Also, the cookies are fabulous, the cakes are scrumptious, and the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is perfect...

One of my favorite Thai  <START:Food> food <END>  places in Vegas!

Because I've changed my eating habits and have successfully lost quite a bit of weight, I try to eat  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  for my mid- <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> . Today was an exception as  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  Craig wanted us to try out two special  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> ...the Hawaiian  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and the Brie  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . My husband was able to try the Hawaiian last week, but this was my big chance and it did not disappoint. The Hawaiian is 100% angus  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  (I get the 1/3lb  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ) topped with delicious ham, melted swiss,  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> , mayo and crushed  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> . I'm going to coin a 90's phrase that I feel is appropriate to describe this  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ....orgasmic. Honestly. I felt the earth move when I bit into this  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>   <START:Food> texture <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>  paired so nicely with the sweetness of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Taste> saltiness <END>  of the ham was just right. It was sheer perfection between a sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END> ! The Brie  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is also 100% angus  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  topped with  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> , sauteed  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , and a slice of brie  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . It is also amazing as well. The  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>  yet tart  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  of the brie really lent itself nicely to the angus  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and even though my son likes his  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  grilled well done, it was still juicy and flavorful. I can't speak highly enough about NY  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back later this week to try something new!

Went here for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  with two friends. As others pointed out, the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is beautiful, rustic yet classy however the  <START:Service> service <END>  was below average and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was ok.  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  forgot our  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , had to come back to the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  twice to ask us what we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  took an incredibly long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to come out and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was only two or three additional  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  filled. We asked to have the bill split three ways, it took the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  three tries to get it correct. Overall, it's probably a nice  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to enjoy a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  but I would not recommend it for a nice  <START:Food> dinner <END>  out.

We stopped here for a quick  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  because my fiancé is a HUGE Ramsay fan.  We got the American Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  sliders (wtf is that really?) which were about $18 for 2, but well  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  it (especially when our entire tab was comped by Trent's casino host).  The presentation was whatever and the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  was high, but let me just say that those things melted in your mouth. It was like eating a filet mignon mini- <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> .  Fantabulous!  I wish we would have know that someone else was  <START:O_Payment> paying <END> , because we definitely would have sprung for the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Wellington for 2.  Oh well, live and learn.

Given the typical airport  <START:Food> food <END>  joints, Beaudevin is a breath of  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  in the midst of CLT's chaos. Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to spend some  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  in between flights.  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list is pretty good and the small  <START:S_Cutlery> plate. <END>  are perfect pairings.

HAPPIEST HOUR! We went to the Fleetwood Mac concert at US airways last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and one of our group had heard that they have an amazing  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> . They couldn't have been more right...They have a nice selection of draft  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  (not super extensive) but either 2 or 3 bucks at  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> , and some killer selections of  <START:Food> food <END>  for the 3-5 dollar range. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and the vibe was great for pre  <START:A_Entertainment> gaming <END>  before a  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> . This is my new stop before any concert or event downtown.

My wife called to ask if they had a  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  that answered said yes, please see it online. My wife looked and when we got here (I'm here now lol), they said "oh yea our website is  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> . Strike one. Seaweed  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  small. Edamame small. Strike 2 was when i asked for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  away from the front door and was told they were "reserved".  At 530pm!? ok !The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was average. Very  <START:F_FI_Size> small pieces <END> . Very loud due to teppan right next to  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . All in an  <START:A_Environment> open area <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are no  <START:A_Decor> walls <END>  or anything. Strike 3 was when they brought out my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  with only half of the nigiri. Weird, if you write "1" for nigiri it's literal, not in pairs as about every other  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I've been to for 20 years all over the globe, does!Well I asked for the rest of the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and I was told if have to be out at the back of the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> . Meaning I'd be waiting much too long. Ridiculous. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was average. Very  <START:F_FI_Size> small pieces <END> . Very loud due to teppan right next to  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . All in an  <START:A_Environment> open area <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are no  <START:A_Decor> walls <END>  or anything. Sakana and Mido are better in all ways. I'd be surprised to see them make it to 2014.

Fantastic! I've watched shows where the host goes to a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , tries their  <START:Food> foods <END>  and explains the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> , textures, and so forth. I never really understood until I came to this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .So I'm going to keep it simple: this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> 's  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> clean <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , made to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . You can  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  every single  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END> , layer by layer. A must go-back-to.

If you like trendy joints check it out. The one  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  had good customer  <START:Service> service <END>  since he switched an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to something else nicely. The  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  not that good. Their specialty are the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> !! You cant go wrong. The  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are freakin amazing! I requested for sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  ( <START:F_Appetizer> sweet   potato   fries <END>  <END>  <END> ). The  <START:F_Ingredients> rosemary <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END>  with 3 strips of  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  was def not  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  the money. Coulda made that myself.

Amazing foooood!!!!That calamari is to die for, it has  <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  jalapeno and freshly made tartar  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that has a kick of  <START:F_FoodItem> lemon <END> . The 4  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  is superb! It  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like a  <START:F_FI_Taste>     crisp <END> . <END>  <END>  calzone and when paired with the homemade  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  it is magical. lolThis is not your traditional  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  it's  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  it's gormet and FULL of  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> !! The  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  put some high dollar restuarants to shame.LOve Love Love

Loved this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ! Sat out of the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  today for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to watch some of the opening  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  Red Sox  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  is amazing.  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Ipswich  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  clams which were relish and straight out of a Cape Cod  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Husband had the Italian, which was enormous and enough to bring home half for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection - more than  <START:Worthiness> worthy <END> . I had the Lobster  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  special and was everything I expected it to be. Thanks for the Cracker Jacks Tim! This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great, be back very soon

I am saddened by the demise of this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  We walked in and had to "yoo hoo" to get  <START:S_Staff> server <END> / <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  attention. The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was pitifully empty on a Saturday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  at 7:30. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  our usual  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  satay  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  which was not "as good as usual",  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was on the dry side and the peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was lumpy. As wew  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for our  <START:Food> food <END> , I saw a bug on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  which i had to deal with under the weight of my flip flop. It was then that i noticed how utterly filthy the  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  was.  My husband agreed, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had undeniably succumbed to a fate several ethnic  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  at this very location have suffered.  We pondered what else could be unwashed beside the floors and what else could possibly be creepy crawlin around the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> . I left with the heebie jeebies and we both agreed we would not venture back. So very sad :(

Whenever I am in this (LAME) part of town, I try to go to this little  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Today I had their  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  with mole. Always amazing! Love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and wish they would be closer to the west side!

We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a 10"  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  with gluten-free  <START:Food> crust <END> ... with feta  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . They said delivery would take about an hour, and they were right. We're literally a mile from them so that was kind of crazy but they told us ahead of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  so not a huge deal.I can't comment on what the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  looks like on the inside because I've never been. We'll  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  again but the lack of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  will ensure that this isn't our  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  spot. Even with us getting *extra*  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  still wasn't a lot. I'm a total cheeseaholic, so that was disappointing. <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  were great, delivery  <START:S_Staff> driver <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . Can't really complain. :)

I REALLY ENJOYED THE  <START:Food> food <END> !  Very  <START:Food> creative <END>  Hispanic  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  as well. The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is quite nice as well. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is brand new and has the formula down pat.  GO NOW GRASS HOPPER!

I'm just an avid  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  lover in a town filled with Japanese-influenced  <START:Food> cuisine <END> , but it isn't as easy to find a great  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for such a raw delicacy as you might think. Furthermore, it is even more difficult to find a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that has delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END> , scrumptious  <START:Food> food <END> , great and  <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , AND a vivacious  <START:Ambience> ambience <END> . Do i need to say anymore? Come see why Kanji has such a high rating for yourself.
