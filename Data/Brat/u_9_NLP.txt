I accidentally scheduled a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  at LaVecchia during  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  week, which frankly could have been a recipe for disaster.  As I'm new to  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END> , I wound up looking for  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  at the old  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END> , sweetheart that  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was, told me  <START:S_Staff> she <END> 'd meet me in the lobby of the new  <START:A_LocatedArea> building <END>  to make sure we found  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .I'm sure the comments previous to mine related to  <START:Service> service <END>  are valid.   However, that was not the case for me.  We got two differing copies of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  week  <START:S_Menu> menus <END> , and our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  merely looked at  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  briefly before telling us to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  whatever we'd like off of either and  <START:S_Staff> she <END> 'd handle  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were also out of the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> , and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  brought us a better bottle and charged us the less  <START:F_FI_Price> expensive <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> .   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was attentive but not intrusive throughout and more or less fell all over herself to make sure we knew how much  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  appreciated we were understanding of the "mistakes".   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's rare for a  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  to go so above and beyond to make sure I'm happy.The  <START:Food> food <END> - decent for upscale.  I had  <START:F_FoodItem> calamari <END>  (average) and a  <START:F_FoodItem> ribeye <END>  that was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  exactly like a medium-rare  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  should be.  My dining partner had  <START:F_FoodItem> tilapia <END> , and I will not judge a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  based on the presentation of that boring ass  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem>   almond   crust <END>  and an appealing  <START:F_FoodItem>   chili   relish <END> .The  <START:Service> service <END>  along merited a return trip.  I'm looking forward to seeing if the  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> merits the rating <END> .
I love  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , and I love the Brooklyn  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  are a beautiful combination atop the thin crust,  <START:F_Ingredients> tomato   sauce   <END> , and  <START:F_Ingredients> mozzarella substrate <END> . All the  <START:F_FoodItem> pies <END>  are excellent actually,  <START:F_FoodItem> monstrous calzones <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  too.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  because I just don't think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were going for that sort of thing,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  certainly won't break your  <START:A_Places> bank <END>  with under $7  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  and average  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> . Possibly better than actual New York  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , but I'll leave that up for debate.
I used to like their foodHonestly. <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was my one year anniversary.Me and me man went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to celebrateI had a  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  tailAnd a filetOn the way home, I got violently illLike, within ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  of leaving  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> .And no, I only had a few glasses of  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END>  :)I ended up going home, and laying on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  for awhile crying, moaning, vomiting, etcAfter about an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> , I couldn't take  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  anymoreI called 911The paramedics showed up, I was naked and crying on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END> . <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a VERY romantic anniversary, let me tell you.After a long night at Scottsdale Osborn hospital,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was determined that the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  tail was undercooked/tainted and made me severly ill.I'll never eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again.Simply because I've never been so sick. <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a shame though, because on the way down, the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  tail had these cajun seasonings and really was exceptionally delicious.HOWEVERI contacted Ruths Chris and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  refunded my  <START:Food> dinner <END>  amount,  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  my hospital copay, and were SOOO nice and accomodating to my every demand.  Bravo.Although, Boo for almost killing me.Eh, I'm torn.
I have lived  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  since 1984 and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was the first  <START:A_Places> place <END>  I ever ate in Arizona as a 5 year old. I keep coming back for more over and over again. I crave  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  constantly! I get the simple  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's super hot on a hot  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and still  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  the same after all these years. Best  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  you will every have as well. Massive  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  is always a bonus. Not giving  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  due to the inside not have been touched in probably 30 years. Needs to be updated a tad, but other than that... <START:Food> food <END>  wise,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's my favorite mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  in AZ. :)
I chose to have a happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> snack <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a couple of days ago.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had been a while since I was a patron  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , and some  <START:F_FoodItem> hummus <END>  sounded amazing at the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . And, as always, the  <START:F_FoodItem> hummus <END>  (all 3) was excellent. I opted to sit on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  overlooking the lake that sits just across a small patch of grass and a concrete pathway. "How did  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  pond get  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ?" I thought for just a moment...then decided I didn't care because my black  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was being brought out to me.The  <START:Service> service <END>  is almost always amazing. The guest ducks, unfortunately, have been trained by those with lesser wills to beg  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> -side for some scraps from your  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> , and subsequently  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  all over the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining   area   <END>   <START:A_Places> floor <END> . All I hear from the white duck is 'quack quack!', which I assume in duckinese means 'more  <START:F_FoodItem> hummus <END> ', but I can't be too sure. I don't even know Spanish. Other than the pandering ducks, my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  was very good again. Looking forward to the next visit!
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a perennial favorite of my husband and I. We love the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and juicy slabs of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  we can choose from. Their  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  also has a nice vibe to  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  when the weather cools off some, the fireplace prevents things from getting too chilly during our short fall and winter seasons. My favorite has always been the prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END> , medium rare almost to the outer edges with a generous helping of  <START:F_FoodItem> horseradish <END>  and au jus. I also can't eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  without the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  Neptune. We  <START:S_Staff> each <END>  get an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to avoid sharing.
I love Liberty Market. I grew up in Gilbert and remember when  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was a small  <START:A_LocatedArea> grocery   store   <END> . I've been wanting to check  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  out since the conversion and I'm so glad I finally stopped by.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was perfect.  <START:Restaurant>   this    <START:A_Places> place <END>  <END>  just feels like home. Casual, but warm. When we walked in my friend and I were lost and didn't know where to start. Luckily one of the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  quickly handed us  <START:S_Menu> menus <END>  and told us where to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . I had a couple of  <START:F_Ingredients> caramel iced <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lattes <END>  and the Liberty Bowl. I loved both. The Liberty Bowl came with 4 big  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  in marinara  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and and two slices of toasted  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was so hard narrowing down my  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were so many delicious looking  <START:Food> items <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and the baked goods display kept calling my name, but I resisted. Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I think I'll just give in and have a  <START:F_FI_Size> slice <END>  of red velvet or  <START:F_Ingredients> carrot <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> , or a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  or a  <START:F_FI_Size> slice <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> zucchini <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  or a sticky  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END> . So much to choose from. I would love to come back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and have a  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and sit and enjoy the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  at the  <START:F_Dessert> espresso <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . Loved all the different  <START:A_Decor> themes <END>  in the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END>  stalls. You have to check  <START:S_Staff> each <END>  one out. Joe was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and stopped by  <START:S_Staff> each <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  to see how  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  was doing. We spent so much  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  chatting and catching up.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END>  to come and hang out. I will be back soon.
What a breath of  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:A_Env_AC> air <END> ! Finally, a market concept done RIGHT! Awesome branding, excellent design,  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . I felt so at home! The  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazing:  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  deli  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> , cranberry, Brie with a  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  tang of  <START:F_FoodItem> horseradish <END> . And the sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  new try. I love how every detail was addressed: well, but not oversized  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  mugs,  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  china, even the  <START:F_Drinks> beverage <END>  station had the perfect set of utensils for my self- <START:Service> service <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> . One  <START:F_FoodItem> critique <END>  would be  <START:Food> breakfast <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  ends at 11a on weekdays and 1p on weekends. As an avid  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  all-day advocate,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  disappoints me. Think about extending those  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END> ! LGO did  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  success. Overall, HUGE fan. If you haven't gone, check  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out!!
Lali J. and I took a  <START:A_OutsideView> road <END>  trip to Tokyo Lobby last night. We'd heard about  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  through excellent reviews in the New  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and the Republic (a positive review in the Republic is often a neon sign that says "stay away," but we decided to risk  <START:Restaurant> it <END> ). As a transplanted New Yorker/San Franciscan/Los Angeleno, I have to say Tokyo Lobby has been my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  in the valley. If you're used to Ra or any of the other McSushi  <START:A_Places> places <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the schlep up to North Glendale (which is almost as far as the Yukon from where we live) to check  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  out.T.L. is a small, 10  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  joint, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's crowded in a vibrant, fun way.  <START:Service> service <END>  is fast and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's in a strip mall, but if you keep your eyes left of center as you approach from the  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot, you won't see the WalMart on your right. The usual/ <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  suspects are brilliant -- stunning unagi, maguro, tobiko, etc. The sides and  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  were fab, too:  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  seaweed  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and gyoza. Tokyo Lobby is creative with the specialty  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  -- the Marilyn Mon- <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  (not kidding) was terrific: a spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  wrapped in albacore with an elegant  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END>  of crispy/crunchy  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> . <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's also a full  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  of earthbound  <START:F_Ingredients> flesh <END>  and assorted other goodies.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  looked  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> . Really -- check  <START:Restaurant>   this    <START:A_Places> place <END>  <END>  out!
The  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent (maybe because I went when  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  weren't that many people  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was AMAZING! I had the veal raviolli.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  didn't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  gamey at all, and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was amazing. i love  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> !
Pros:  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:A_Environment> environment <END> . Open 24/7 .  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  phó. Phone  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  easy to go . The red been  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  is awesome! Over all good  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END> .Cons: hit or miss with the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . Sometimes I feel rushed .
Last week - I dropped by the Aloha  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  and  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . Had high hopes that  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  would be a  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  that would come  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to being like the  <START:Food> food <END>  I love and miss when I'm back home on the islands. However - I've learned to live with disappointment in life and my visit  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  was just another added to that list. The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining   area   <END>  is nice - somewhat clean, open and modern(ish) compared to other "local" style  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  I've been to. The names of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  were promising and the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  seemed in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  with the  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> sizes <END>  I had seen on people's  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  as I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  to  <START:A_Places> place <END>  my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . I was coming down with a cold so I wanted  <START:F_FoodItem> saimin <END>  - even with  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  being in the 90's and humid which  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't  <START:S_Staff> serve <END> . A Hawaiian style  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  that doesn't  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> saimin <END>  - odd. Even fast  <START:Food> food <END>  joints in Hawaii  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> saimin <END> .  At least  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  fried  <START:F_FoodItem> saimin <END> . So, I settled for that. Too much  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  which normally isn't a bad thing however, after a few  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END> , I started to separate the  <START:F_Ingredients> cabbage <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> celery <END> . Sorted thru and picked out the minced  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  and with the leftover  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looked like I hadn't made a dent in the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . I also chose a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> macaroni <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Ugh. All I'm going to say is that I have to wonder if the  <START:S_Staff> cooks <END>  have ever been to the islands. Either that or the  <START:S_Staff> cooks <END>  have started tayloring their  <START:Food> dishes <END>  to the  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  of people who haven't been either. Or maybe, I didn't choose the right  <START:Food> dishes <END>  that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  specialize in ... whatever the case, I didn't like what I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and I doubt I'll be back any  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  soon.
I love  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's easily one of my favorite  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END> .The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  -  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a beautiful  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a very intimate  <START:A_Environment> setting <END>  and is a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Ambience> spot <END>  for a romantic date night. But  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  still manages to maintain a simplistic charm. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is absolutely delicious. I usually get the  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> , and recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wholeheartedly. The  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list is extensive and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is wonderful. No complaints.
Went during  <START:Food> lunch <END>  over the weekend, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was easily one of the very best Indian  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  I've had a chance to eat at.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  was delicious, as were all of the vegetarian options  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  Whereas  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  doesn't seem a major thing, the condiment  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ;  <START:F_FoodItem> chutneys <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> raita <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> kheer <END> , etc, was one of the most complete I've seen.Will head  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again.
the discovery of  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  in 2004 forever changed my tastebuds.  since  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  now, i can finally review based on the  <START:Restaurant> store <END>  when  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  first  <START:S_OpenHours> opened <END>  and i fell in love with  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , and not after the shady change in business  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  where i boycotted the last year or so anyway.$5 for delicious  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  of dumplings, either  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  or  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END> , either  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  or spicy.  i always got spicy half and half (half  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END> , half  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ), never with sour cream tho cuz i don't like the stuff.  just 1 extra dollar for a  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was among the cheapest, most filling dinners in  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END> .  as a campus "safewalker," i stopped  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  nearly every night i worked for my  <START:Food> dinner <END> .before  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END> , i bought up several  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  for freezing (which  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  let you do), and rationed  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  out for months after their  <START:S_OpenHours> closing <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  let me in on the secret for the spicy  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> .~ <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> ~a little  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  vinegar~cilantro~ <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  powder~srirachatop that with a piece of pumpernickel, and you have nothing short of pure magic.  5 years later i still have dreams about  <START:Restaurant>   this    <START:A_Places> place <END>  <END> , and once even tried requesting a  <START:F_FoodItem> pel meni <END>  mold for my birthday (still  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  on one of those - HINT HINT people)!when i moved to boston, i was thrilled to find a russian  <START:A_LocatedArea> grocery  <START:Restaurant> store <END>  <END>  that had frozen  <START:F_FoodItem> pel meni <END> .  tho i have tried both their packaged and their home-made  <START:S_Menu> varieties <END> , nothing has come  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to the madison gem.original  <START:F_FoodItem> pel meni <END>  genious  - if you're reading, please PLEASE come to boston!  i will eat  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at your  <START:Restaurant> store <END>  and bring throngs to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  mecca - just please make  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  dream a reality!  i suppose i'd settle on just learning your  <START:F_FoodItem> pel meni <END>  recipe if nothing else...
Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for brunch yesterday (Sat) ... two words, stay away!Yes, the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  look  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  ... but if  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  good Indian  <START:Food> food <END>  you're looking for, Taj is a big let down. The brunch  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  was sparse, most  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:F_Drinks> watered <END>  down ( <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  nothing like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  should),  <START:Food> food <END>  didn't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  & to make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  worse - my glass of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  had stuff floating in  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .
Working in the Capitol  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  for 15 years, La Canasta Capitolio is a must.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are very few  <START:A_Places> places <END>  to eat near the Capitol, but La Canasta not only provides a  <START:A_Places> place <END>  for a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat, but some good  <START:Food> food <END>  as well. I don't like  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> , so I generally stick to the red  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , which is very good.   <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are reasonable, too. I think their  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  business comes from the government workers in the  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> , and lot's of police and fifi's (firefighters).  If the PD and fifi's eat  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  must be good.  Free  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  (very GOOD  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> ) is a definite plus! Also, I've heard their  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> 's are excellent.
I was visiting Arizona from New York & came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to celebrate my dear friends birthday. We also came to see another friend perform with his  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> band <END> . The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  are all very handsome  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  & really gorgeous "pin up" girl looking ladies. I am not a  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  drinker. I love  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  but I get the bubble guts when I  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  (yeah, i know TMI). Anyway,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very intimidating to hear that we were going to a  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . However, the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was super sweet & accomadating.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  actually recreated a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  for me called a " <START:F_Drinks> cherry bomb <END> " that I had at Blue Wasabi which is my new favorite  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . Of course,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't exactly the same but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was still pretty good. I was really impressed with the fact that the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  went out of  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  way to get me something that I could  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> .  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  even stopped me at one point & said " I feel like you are not happy. I really want to make you happy". That was so super sweet of  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  & I gave  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  a very good tip for all of  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  efforts.I didn't try the  <START:Food> food <END> .The  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  &  <START:S_Staff> waitresses <END>  & live  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> band <END>  are  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  seeing.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  ia a bit pricey so be prepared to spend some money. Also, the  <START:A_OutsideView> entrance <END>  is in the back of the club so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is hard to find  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . Thank God my friend came out to get us.I will definitely be back in the future if  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  permits  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .
I am sitting  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  as I type  <START:Restaurant> this <END> .  My wife,  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  parents and I were visiting from out of  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END>  and decided to drop by an " <START:Food> italian <END>  deli" for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  Firstly  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  is closer to a deli you'd find on New York rather than one in Italy.  In  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> , I heard two people  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  fettuccine Alfredo for  <START:Food> lunch <END> ... So,  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> :  one  <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  (one if the few  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ),  one  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , one portobello  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and one  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  panini.  While I was  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END> ,  the  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  ( the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ) kept giving me an odd look...like "who do you think you  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ?"  I also got a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  which was on display.  When I asked for  <START:Restaurant> it <END> ,   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  didn't know what  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was so I had to  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  him the bottle.  Also, the request to have a double  <START:F_Dessert> espresso <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  made later seemed to give him and an associate all kinds of inconvenience.   <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's what we got:The  <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was good albeit a bit greasy.The  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was OK.The portobello  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  NEVER arrived.  Instead we got another half of a  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .  When I told  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  to the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said "If you want portobello I'll make you one."  No apologies no cares.   When  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  finally came out,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was bad.The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  panini (which had  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  in  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !) was nasty.When I went to ask for a  <START:S_Cutlery> knife <END> ,  the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  said that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  should be out by the  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  machine.  I informed him  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were not.   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  screamed for 'Ernesto to bring out the  <START:S_Cutlery> knives <END> " and told me "the should be out soon, I THINK".  Also got first apology of the day.The  <START:F_Dessert> espresso <END>  was atrocious.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's beyond words how bad  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is.   Really awful. Seriously.Finally,  to add injury to insult, we were overcharged 50c .   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was explained as a computer error.  We got the money back.Will NEVER return.
a friend of our's found  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  on Yelp, saying  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was the #2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rated <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  so we had to give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a try since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to where we live.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's in a strip mall and I would never have expected a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  to exist  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  and  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is nice.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a pri fix  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  for $55 which includes 1  <START:Food> entree <END>  and 2 something else ( <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , or  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ). Our favorite  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  was the  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  (  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  told us  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a signature  <START:Food> dish <END> ). The  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was the favorite for the  <START:Food> entree <END>  and for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  exactly like a warm  <START:F_Ingredients> almond <END>  joy. YUMM,  <START:Restaurant>   this    <START:A_Places> place <END>  <END>  also gave out little extra  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  at the end (  <START:F_Ingredients> mint <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> chocololate <END> , peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  balls, and lemon thing) That's a nice touch to end the  <START:Food> meal <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was impeccable, almost better than any on the strip  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> !
Before eating at Hikari, I have tried only two other all you can eat  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  joints. Todai in Honolulu, and Midori  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in Los Angeles. In a fight between the 3 I think Hikari wins hands down. I had 4 pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> hamachi <END> , 4 uni, 4  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> , 2  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> , 2  <START:F_FoodItem> ikura <END> , 1  <START:F_FoodItem> tamago <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END> ...  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  must have been a good catch  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had come in because  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and melt in your mouth  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was really good too!With a ratio of 5 to 1 I think the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  had a really good memory for the amount of  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  had to deal with too.I will definitely be back when I go Vegas again... I may even write another review; Regardless of the fact that reminiscing of the  <START:Food> food <END>  creates so much hunger pain.
I love  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> ! The bakery is in the front. But walk down the aisle on the side of the bakery and you will discover a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . A trattoria. Sit down. Relax.  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . A  <START:Food> dish <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> . Or a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  to dip your biscotti in.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  mixes and matches in the back. Ask for Larry- the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> !
The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was pretty nice when we first stepped in.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  accommodated to our party of ten in a reasonable  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . Upon  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and a few bottles of $10  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> . The catch is that you have to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  $10 of  <START:Food> food <END>  in  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to take advantage of the deal. Then the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  began. The  <START:Food> food <END>  took what seemed like forever and a day, I was thinking about eating the  <START:F_FI_Size> slice <END>  of lemon in my  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   to stave the hunger. However, when  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  finally came I was surprised at the  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  of some of the  <START:Food> meals <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  and what came out did not resemble  <START:Food> anything <END>  like a  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a bunch of  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  thrown onto a tortilla and that was  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . I've had better attempts of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  at Rubio's.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was a true testament that sometimes  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's better to get  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  then  <START:F_FI_Size> quantity <END> . We had  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  of S'mores and that was probably their only saving grace. Although  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's nothing more than your normal  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> , but the fact that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:Service> served <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  made the end a little more tolerable.
Well, if I recall correctly,  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's three types of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , a few  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , a few types of  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>   and a few  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  on tap, but one  <START:S_Staff> bartendress <END>  that made us come back more than once. What  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:Service> service <END> . :)Also, I was eating too much  <START:F_FI_Price> expensive <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and needed to get back to earth and not be too addicted to Vegas. The  <START:S_Staff> bartendress <END>  looked like a trained  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> dancer <END> , I wished I remembered to ask  <START:S_Staff> her <END> . Which reminds me,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a whole lot of trained theater  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> dancers <END>  in Vegas. Five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for that.
3 and 1/2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a build a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  type  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , named #2  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  joint in Las Vegas.  You pick your type of  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  including kobe, sustainable, sirloin, etc and other including  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> patty <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> , etc.  Then you can pick your  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  -  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> , sesame, whole wheat, ciabatta, etc,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheeses <END>  - pepperjack, swiss, american, cheddar, etc, and fixings:   <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> , etc,  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  -  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END> , shallot reduction, etc.Some  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  are already built for you and you got your schmancy ones including a $60  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , etc.Pick your side of  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> :  Skinny,  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END> .First  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  I picked the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  which was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , but I don't remember too much about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .Second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a sustainable on wheat w/swiss  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and shallot reduction.. honestly,  <START:F_FoodItem> patty <END>  didn't have much  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> , and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  didn't either so my  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  pretty  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END> .  Good  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  and small TV for  <START:S_Staff> each <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END> .  While the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  for a typical  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  isn't through the roof, (around $20) your best bet if you're pinching your wallet would be the slider  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , three cute sliders w/ <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  for only $12.95.
Whether  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just for a couple  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , a lite  <START:Food> lunch <END>  or for a full  <START:Food> dinner <END> , Mesa Grill is always a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:S_Menu> choice <END> .The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has a vast array of Southwestern flavored  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  should be something on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  for  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END> . We have eaten  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  on several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and have yet to be disappointed. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is very attentive and professional and simply add to the enjoyment of your  <START:Food> meal <END> .The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  right in the heart of Caesars Palace, so  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END>  to enjoy a  <START:Food> meal <END>  and then go catch a  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  or enjoy some  <START:A_Entertainment> gaming <END> . Definitely  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  checking out.
 <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Week Review I have to preface  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  review with,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is my first visit  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and we came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  specifically for  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  week, the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .Original plan was to sit  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  on the nice terrace overlooking the Bellagio  <START:A_Decor> fountains <END> , but the weather prevented us from doing that, so the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  sat us next to the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END> , which was perfect. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  suggested 2 of his favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  specialties from the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , I wish I could remember the names of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were so good.For my app I went with Crispy Lamb Riblets; Sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> raita <END> , Lamb Reduction, Honeyed Yogurt, Micro  <START:F_Ingredients> mint <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was delicious. And rather large for an app,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> , a little crunch on the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  and tender on the inside. My friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Wild  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  Tart; Caramelized  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> , Herbed Imported Goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>  Essence.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  also was delicious, had the perefect amount of every  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END> .We both chose the same  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  course, Pacific Sole Milanese; Creamy Fava  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END> , Garlicky  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> , Lemon  <START:F_Ingredients> caper <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  Emulsion, Shaved Fennel Insalata.  Right away I noticed  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looked greasy, I think the combination of the Milanese with the  <START:F_Ingredients> caper <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  emulsion made  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  very heavy and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  covered the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of the Sole. I kept having to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  after every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . I loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  under the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , so that's what I ended up eating. Dissapointed because I ended up not eating the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> .We both chose the same  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  as well, Tiramisu Cannoli; Cinnamon Spiced  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> espresso <END>  cream.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was a different twist on tiramsu, which is one of my favorite  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had a good  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> , nothing spectacular.
Id give  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  3 1/2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  if  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  werent for the LONG  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> lines <END>  and bitchy  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  was fair and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  was pretty good.  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  at 1:30pm on a Monday for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . Tried to go to  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at 6pm the night before but the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  was out into the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>  and although we didnt  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  prob would have been at least 90  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  or longer. At one point I went to scoop some  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  onto my  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  but the only  <START:S_Cutlery> spoon <END>  in the  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  was slotted;/ so I borrowed the sppon next to  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  (which was not in  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END> ) and the man behind the sneeze glass came unglued!!! LOL  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  shouted "why you not ask me for different  <START:S_Cutlery> spoon <END> ? Now  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  all contaminated and I cannot  <START:S_Staff> serve <END> !!!!" I apologized but suggested  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  wasnt standing  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  when I needed the  <START:S_Cutlery> spoon <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  silly to put a slotted  <START:S_Cutlery> spoon <END>  in  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  but  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  wasnt listening and didnt care as  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was too busy acting like an overdramatic little bitch.  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> , rotisserie  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> ......decent  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  for B, L & D (approx $15, $20, and $30). Be prepared to eat off schedule  <START:Food> meals <END>  or  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in a long  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> .
Our  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  was awesomely delicious. And that's coming from someone who generally avoids junk  <START:Food> food <END>  altogether. After the first  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  my husband and I agreed we need to come back to La Creperie the next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we're in Vegas.
 <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  and the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  were solid.  Would have given add'l  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  if the  <START:Service> service <END>  was kicked up a couple notches.  For a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  caliber, overall  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was par at best.Marketing side note - lose the life- <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  cutout ads of Rick all over the  <START:A_Places> place <END> ...pretty tacky.
As soon as I found out I would be traveling to Phoenix, I began looking up  <START:A_Places> places <END>  to eat. Matt's Big  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  was the first thing to crank up my Yelpdar!B R I E F  S U M M A R Y-- Probably the most reviewed/well known  <START:A_Places> place <END>  in downtown Phoenix-- Featured on TV like  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  else said--  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  newer  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is a block further than the old (way bigger now!)-- Warm & welcoming  <START:Ambience> ambience <END> --  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and attentive  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  (seems like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a system)-- I recommend coming early, only 6  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  @ 6:45am (Wed morning)--  <START:F_FoodItem> salami scramble <END>  was definitely unique but needed some  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> --  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  had decent  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> rosemary <END> ) but I wish I got hash browns-- Waffle was hot &  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  & syrup was high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> -- Sourdough  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>  was thick & good-- Strawberry preserves were delicious!-- The regular  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is very limited--  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  recommends trying the  <START:Offers> specials <END> -- Very sad I couldn't try the french  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's ONLY a  <START:Offers> special <END> ! :(Well I woke up super early because I didn't want to get stuck  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and I had a meeting at 8am! I forgot that AZ is an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  ahead of CA. I woke up so tired and barely made  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at 6:45am. I walked from the Westin which was a healthy walk at 6 in the morning! I was a bit disappointed to find the old  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  but luckily I saw the new  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  was only a block further.I really like the feel and  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  of Matt's Big  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  (MBB). The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were all ladies and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and attentive even at 6am! I was barely awake and I wasn't sure if I was going to come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again so I ended up  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  basically 2  <START:Food> dishes <END>  so I could try 2 things. My  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  loves the waffle so I had to get  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . The  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  also recommended but I'm just not a fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  so I opted for the  <START:F_FoodItem> salami scramble <END> . I'm from the San Francisco bay  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  so I'm almost accustomed to what MBB is doing with  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , local  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> . I applaud  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  for keeping their  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  so high but I wasn't uberly impressed because I'm sort of used to  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . I expect to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  a decent amount of money for high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> food <END> . I didn't feel like MBB was overpriced, I thought the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  were about right in my opinion.The waffle was above average and I could  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the syrup. I really wanted the french  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>  but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't being offered. To me, if you're famous for french  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END> , you should offer  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  on your  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ! Nevertheless, the waffle is a good alternative. The  <START:F_FoodItem> salami scramble <END>  was so unique and different. I've never had  <START:Food> anything <END>  quite like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  but I really wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would have added some creamy  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  to smooth out the salami after  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . I think I added some ketchup or hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  to my  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  helped balance the salami. If you like salami, I recommend. I probably wouldn't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  again, I just was feeling adventurous. I was a bit surprised that the sourdough  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was so thick but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was still good. The preserves really enabled me to eat all of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  otherwise  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would been just too much  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  for me.Clearly  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  is living up to the hype as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is the number 1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rated <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END>  in downtown Phoenix. I didn't search further than that because I didn't have a rental car or  <START:Food> anything <END> . I would definitely recommend coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and if I'm ever out  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again, I hope that I can grab some of their french  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END> !
PRO:  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is not very busy for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and you can easily grab a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and a quick  <START:Food> lunch <END>  when other  <START:A_Places> places <END>  nearby are busy. Not a bad  <START:A_Places> place <END>  to eat and have a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> .CON: A pretty average  <START:Ambience> spot <END>  with no  <START:Offers> special <END>  flair. Nothing  <START:Offers> special <END> .I have been a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and will go again.
what?!? i had  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for 10pm for my girlfriends birthday ( <START:S_OpenHours> closes <END>  at 11) the host tells me  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  'feel like'  <START:S_OpenHours> closing <END>  early, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  won't  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  us. i ask to speak to the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  says  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  won't allow that.. the  <START:F_Drinks> patrons <END>  who were leaving when were denied said  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was gross and super greasy anyway
If you choose to eat at what  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  used to call, " <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:Restaurant> shops <END> " (you know, the 24  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> , huge  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ,  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  all day  <START:A_Places> places <END> ) then  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Bellagio is as nice as  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  come. <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's so luxurious sitting in  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Bellagio and peering out into the Conservatory, having the aromas of the  <START:A_Decor> flowers <END>  and being able to see all the seasonal displays.  If you go, ask to sit  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to the Conservatory, instead of in the back of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  where all you get to see is Keno screen.The  <START:Service> service <END>  at  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Bellagio is  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> ; I asked specifically for watermelon on my  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  made sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  happened (by having someone run to another  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  to aquire some).  I would recommend  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Bellagio to anyone wanting to enjoy  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  by the Conservatory, or anyone that wants a reasonably  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> .
We used a  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .com deal to try  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  local  <START:Ambience> spot <END>  for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . We were definitely charmed by the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  and  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Places> space <END> , but not so much by the $25 yucky short  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  and $12  <START:F_Drinks> watered <END>  down  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . The sides (cornbread and creamed  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END> -  <START:S_Staff> waitresses <END>  selections) were decent the  <START:F_FoodItem> empanada <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  had good  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  but again all wayyy overpriced. Won't be back.
My husband and I LOVE  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's right down the street from us so  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's super convenient! The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are always nice and super  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is really easy going and the Original Philly Cheesesteak sandwhichs are AWESOME!!!!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's the only thing I ever  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  because why mess with the best?  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are very reasonable. Just wish the shopping center  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in was easier to access. And I wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Delivery> delivered <END> ! ;)
We visited  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  on a Saturday afternoon and we didn't have to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> . Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was pretty nice at first. My husband and I  <START:S_Staff> each <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  one of their  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  with a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were very greasy and mushy.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were not appetizing at all. I left most of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  on my  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  honestly looked like something I could have made at home and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  didn't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  any better. As we were eating, we noticed the  <START:A_Places> place <END>  began to get a little more crowded. That was when the  <START:Service> service <END>  from our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  got bad.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  never came back to refill our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  or ask if we needed  <START:Food> anything <END> .  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  simply came by to give us our  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was like  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was rushing us out. Very rude. I will not be going back, the  <START:Food> food <END>  really sucked and the  <START:Service> service <END>  really sucked.
How could one not be a fan of Carnevino?!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's amazing! The  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent, and the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were flowing. If you find yourself in Vegas craving a really good piece of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , and have an overflowing wallet,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the  <START:A_Places> place <END>  to go! While the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  were a little high for my  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END> , our traveling buddies wanted to take us  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . We definitely enjoyed our  <START:Food> meal <END> , by far  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was amazing. I sampled things I hadn't before, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was all around enjoyable. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent, many different  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  stopped by our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  for different things, and  <START:S_Staff> each <END>  was extremely professional and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . I absolutely loved the  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  side  <START:Food> dish <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was by far my favorite. I also LOVED the  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  with the  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  (who woulda thunk?), that was amazing. The  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> , if you have the budget to spend.
We ate  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Sienna on Sunday night and, yet again, found a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END>  to eat in Uptown Charlotte. We were surprised to have the  <START:A_Places> place <END>  almost all to ourselves, but then again,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a Sunday night and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was rainy. We loved the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  - from the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  I can see how  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  might be mistaken for a high  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  snooty  <START:A_Places> place <END> , as a previous reviewer pointed out, and just like him, we were mistaken -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was laid back and affordable! We were very happy with the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , which offers a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  of antipasti,  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , and  <START:Food> entrees <END> , which range from  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , veal,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> . We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the portabello for an app, along with the mussels. The mussels were the largest I have ever seen! (see pic). And  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were delicious. The portabello was very good and my only complaint  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is that  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  wasn't enough of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  between my fiancee and I. One thing I wasn't too happy with: the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  bring you when you sit down.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , like  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ! Not even toasted or  <START:Food> anything <END> , just a few pieces from a  <START:F_FoodItem> loaf <END>  you buy at your local  <START:A_LocatedArea> grocery   store   <END> . Maybe  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just because  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a Sunday, but we thought that was pretty weird. But once we  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  we didn't even notice the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  anymore anyway. The  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  was excellent,  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was brought to us on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  knew the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and made  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Service> recommendations <END> . For my  <START:Food> entree <END> , I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  with pesto over angel hair  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  -  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  alone is a 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:Food> dish <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just enough, not too thick to make you feel sick after, just the perfect blend of  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , pesto,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  - amazing! My fiancee  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the filet mignon with the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  over  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was happy with  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , although  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  did say the filet was pretty mediocre, and then if  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  didn't have the crabmeat on top  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wouldn't have been  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:Offers> special <END> . But regardless, both  <START:Food> dishes <END>  were very good and we both agreed we will totally be going back!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's on our list of  <START:A_Places> places <END>  to take family members when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  visit.
Five  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  makes the best  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  I have ever had in my life, period.
We met another couple  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  last week and had a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  We've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  before and were again, pleased.  The happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  are very good.  The indoor/ <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  &  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  is roomy and nice.  The  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  we've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> , (sorry, I forgot his name........a tall man) is always so  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .  Check  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out, you won't be disappointed!
Decided to try  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> . For a fast  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is very overpriced.The  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was dripping with  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> , and was otherwise fairly  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> curds <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , but the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are merely average. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was decent at least.
 <START:Service> service <END>  - 4Atmosphere - 4Food - 6Vegetarian  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  - 7General Awesomeness - 5We had a party of about 10 for brunch on a Sunday morning, and had an incredibly difficult  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  receiving the most basic  <START:Service> service <END> .  Getting a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  took 4 requests and about 20 min, the rest of the  <START:Food> meal <END>  followed a similar path.
I love  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> !! I could eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  almost every day.  <START:Service> service <END>  is always  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  with little  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .
Discovered Siena Bistro last spring.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's been a favorite for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  ever since.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's lovely to sit  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  and enjoy the  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  and peacefulness.The frittata and  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  carbonara are  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  has always been attentive.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's really a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  value.
Awesome to find out that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a regular open mic/live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  schedule
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is, hands down, the absolute best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END>  (not counting the fancy shmancy or seaside  <START:A_Places> places <END> ).  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a bit hidden because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  inside a higher end  <START:A_LocatedArea> grocery   store   <END>  (that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also own), but once you find  <START:Restaurant> it <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's like a hidden gem that you either want to keep for yourself or  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  off to the whole world. I kid you not, I make the trip down to Montréal whenever I can, just to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  are such good people, and their  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  characters  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  through the carefully prepared  <START:Food> dishes <END> , which by the way are also presented in generous proportions.
I've only ever had take-out from  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , and I've always enjoyed the  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's good  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> chinese <END> -Canadian  <START:Food> food <END> , and I've never been disappointed in a  <START:Food> dish <END> . The Sesame  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  really does set  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  apart though. You have to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .My  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  have always been filled quickly, and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is pleasant.
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Ambience> spot <END>  was my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END>  in the West Valley.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . Most of my out of  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END>  guests even my pickiest of friends loved  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . The only complaint is that sometimes the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  are overwhelmed on the weekends and I don't get refills on my  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  on those days.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  need to hire more  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  for the busy weekends... <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  is always packed with customers. I will eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  everytime I come back to  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END>  even without the refills on  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  the Las Vegas  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  is awesome !
I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , mostly because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to my house but I like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is a little loud but if you are into 85 TV's displaying 40 different  <START:A_Entertainment> sports <END>  programs  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's all good.  What brings me back ... their mojito's ... love 'em.
The  <START:Food> food <END>  is good.  I had the queso with bits of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was good.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was something you could grab at other decent Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is not necessarily the problem with  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> . <START:Restaurant> this <END> ...my friends....is another tourist trap.  The  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are in the stratosphere for the  <START:Food> food <END>  you get.  The  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is smack dab in the middle of the pyramid.  Imagine  <START:Restaurant> this <END> :  You are eating a  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  and enjoying your  <START:Food> meal <END>  when you look up and see an ad for the Bodies Exhibit...with the dude's guts all hanging out.  Pretty bad right?  Now imagine you see the Bodies Exhibit ad and so you turn around to see....gasp....an ad for the  <START:F_Ingredients> carrot <END>  Top  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> ....with his ugly mug staring right back at you.I lost my  <START:F_Appetizer> appetite <END>  after seeing  <START:F_Ingredients> carrot <END>  Top, and I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  a fortune for ok mexican  <START:Food> food <END> .  That is what is wrong with  <START:Restaurant>   this    <START:A_Places> place <END>  <END> .
The  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  is different everyday. The  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  said Saturdays and Sundays are the best days to come. You can also check the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  of the day in fb.
I used to love  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  but now the  <START:Service> service <END>  has gone downhill,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  got rid of their good iced  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and substituted  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with some chemical-taating off brand, their  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  have gone WAY UP.  $9.75 for a sald with  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  in a stripmall joint is way too much, the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was rude and the greek  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  is sooooooo loud.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  added the suite next  <START:Restaurant> store <END>  to their dinig  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> , so  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  raised all their  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  by 2 or 3 dollars  <START:S_Staff> each <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  to compensate.  I liked  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  a lot better when  <START:Restaurant> thy <END>  were smaller, friendlier and didnt cut corners on the  <START:Food> food <END> .  Sadly  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  will be or last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
Based on décor alone, Boca 7 would get four  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for all  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> -out-of- <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  glam in Mesa.  The design work by the dentist/co- <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  is totally over the top.  The devil is in the details and a few of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  need tweaking.  The heights of the black crystal chandeliers and huge red fabric spheres need to be varied to make the  <START:Ambience> ceiling <END>  look less cluttered.   <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  is also in desperate need of a dimmer switch.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is tradition that Asian  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  be  <START:A_Decor> lit <END>  like  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're in the middle of a raid to emphasize that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are clean, but all those chandeliers blazing on high are too much at Boca 7.  The screw heads used to affix the huge Asian symbols to the back  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  also need to be hidden.  And what's with putting the cheapest paper  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  on the market on the granite  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> ?  When you've spent  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  much money on the  <START:A_Decor> interior <END> , either get a nice paper  <START:S_Cutlery> napkin <END>  or splash out for cloth  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END> .  Unfortunately, the  <START:Food> food <END>  does not live up to the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> .  Compared to a Vietnamese gem like Cyclo, the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is a bit of a disappointment.   <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's nothing wrong with  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the  <START:Food> food <END>  I would expect to find in a very  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  Vietnamese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  However,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:A_Environment> setting <END>  makes me expect something much more modern.  Perhaps the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  should look to Jin Ju in Chicago as a template to follow as I think that  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is much closer to the concept of mod Asian fare in a hip  <START:A_Environment> setting <END>  that would work for  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> .  Now whether or not that concept will actually work in Mesa is another question altogether.   The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is a hoot.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's filled with advertising and reads like a gay who's who of Phoenix dentists and bankruptcy lawyers.   <START:Restaurant>   this    <START:A_Places> place <END>  <END>  is  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  a visit just to check out the décor.  If Liberace had been Vietnamese,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  could have been his  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .
I love their pumpkin  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  the most.
thanks to Groupon's $6 for $12 coupon I probably wouldn't know about  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> . My first expeirence with New Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  so didn't know what to expect. Similar  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  as your typical Mexican restuarant and a few of their own. Had the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  Carlito's  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  (pic) which i really liked for $7.60 with all of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's 8 complimentary add-ons,  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , and so on.  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and sour cream was extra.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was loaded with  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  chunks of  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , i could definitely  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  a difference in the  <START:F_Ingredients> spices <END>  and seasoning.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also have a  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  for $4.60 that you can mixup all kind of  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  together, or the combo  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  for around $6-7 which is the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .Total wasn't $12 yet so I added the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>    <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  for also $7.60.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  weren't that bad, had a bunch of  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  that resembled those layered  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  dips what I usually eat while watching football.  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> guacomole <END> , and sour cream and some large  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  pieces. didn't care for their  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> , shaped and seasoned like doritos, and got soggy quickly. <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a good nightly  <START:Offers> special <END>  from 4-9pm.Mondays - Santa Fe Sliders for $1Tuesdays - <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  for $1Wednesday - HUMP DAY - 1/2 off  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  till 11 am and $6  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> .Thurdays - Bottomless bowls green chile shew for $6.50.Friday -  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  fajitas from $6-8.Saturaday - Ribs for $8.95Sunday - 2 for 1  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>  all day. <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> margaritas <END> , and  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  so that's cool. <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were busy during  <START:Food> lunch <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and a few  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  counters to eat at. also like all of their  <START:A_Decor> pictures <END>  and their open  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  of the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> .
Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END>  1/31/12.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had the unlimited  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  tail for $70  <START:Offers> special <END> . Really liked their  <START:S_Menu> selection <END> . Nice  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimps <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs were already  <START:S_OpenHours> opened <END>  for easy eating. Good overall.
If you are in some serious craving for some gourmet  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , come  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ! You have to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  a little, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> !You get a  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  of their pre-made  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  or you can just CUSTOMIZE  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !  You get to choose a huge array of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and other nice sautéed  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> .  What makes their  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  extra good is the  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> patty <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  is sooo soft and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END>  while the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  is so perfectly made.After the first  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> , I just kept eating away.  I never finished a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  so fast. Hehehehe! =)
The  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  of Fugu is a huge bonus. Being  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  on State St right on campus,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's definitely popular amongst students especially.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  good Sze Chuan  <START:Food> food <END> , which means that the majority of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  will be  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  with spicy oil -- making  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  spicy. Their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  actually runs pretty parallel to that of Ichiban. I have written a review of that pretty recently and I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and recommend the same favorites as I do at Ichiban. Plus,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are many reviews of Fugu out  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  with good  <START:Service> recommendations <END>  on what to get, so I will talk more about the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Went to  <START:Food> lunch <END>  once for my post-seminar celebration with my group. We had the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END> , which was a good deal coming to about $10.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has a set consisting of the  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  course, a  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fruits <END>  to go with  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . Most of their sets are  <START:Service> served <END>  in bento boxes, which is a pretty cool concept. For  <START:Food> dinner <END>  you just  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  off their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . <START:Service> service <END>  wise,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a little off what I could call top-notch. Which means that your  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  course  <START:Food> dishes <END>  might come before or together with your  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> . On some occasion especially when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are busy, you might have to remind  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  about parts of your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . But  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are pretty good about reminders, and will get you what you want fast. I would visit more often but Ichiban has equally good Sze Chuan delicacies with a much larger sitting  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  and ample  <START:S_Parking> parking <END> . Between one or the other  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  all  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> boils <END>  down to personal preference and convenience. If I live downtown and I do not have a car, Fugu will be the logical option. Otherwise, take your pick, either way you will get nice Sze Chuan  <START:Food> dishes <END>  =)
Wow, I went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  today without checking reviews. Thank god I didn't because I would have missed out on a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> . Maybe  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are better when  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  slow. Anyways,  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's my take: <START:Service> service <END>  - Very good, our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  checked up on us twice, brought  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  all within 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  was hot,  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were cold, 9.5/10 because  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very slow so no excuses. <START:Food> food <END> / <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> : Once again very good. I had the quesadilla cancun and the filling was as hot as a fajita when I dug in.  <START:F_Drinks> margaritas <END>  were also decent, not as strong as I like but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was only 4pm so  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's ok. My only complaint was the  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  were a tad cold. Otherwise 9/10. <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was $40 for two  <START:Food> meals <END>  and two  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  including tip, for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a decent  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> . Could have had a larger  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  of sides, so Id give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a 8/10. <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  - Very  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  at 4pm, Im sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  picks up after 6. Very colorful  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with nice  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  and pretty cool carved tabletops and  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END> , although a little cramped in the  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a nice looking mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . 8/10.Overall - 34.5/40 - Thank god the reviews below are no longer the case,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a very good  <START:Food> meal <END>  and I will be back. Maybe  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a change of  <START:S_Staff> management <END> ? I would reccommend  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> .
Never seen so many kids work so hard at a fast  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  was crazy and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are getting  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  in and out.  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  job  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> 
i know  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  a fast  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> chain <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but normally the  <START:Food> food <END>  is pretty decent but when i went to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  one,  <START:Service> service <END>  was very slow and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was so so. I do not think i will be coming back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again.
I'm not a fan of Golden Corral, but since my parents got coupons we went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for brunch. All Golden Corrals are pretty cheap considering the amount of  <START:Food> food <END>  you can actually eat. The  <START:Food> food <END>  wasn't bad,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and since we went 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  before  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  was over we got to get the chance of getting free  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_Drinks> juice <END> .I walked in and saw a  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:A_Decor> fountain <END> , which I don't think I've seen in any other Golden Corrals before. I grew up going to these  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , so as default I got sick of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and never come.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  Golden Corral was pretty new, right to the new  <START:S_OpenHours> opened <END>  Walmart,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in the right  <START:A_Places> place <END>  for business.The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and helped with any  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and picking up  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> cooks <END>  were also helpful if you wanted something from the grill. Bathrooms were pretty clean, so if you need a break and need to drop some weight to eat more, you're welcome to do  <START:Restaurant> it <END> ! Haha.Very diverse  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  which makes Golden Corral feel more homey and you could get a nice look of the diversity in Charlotte. Anyways, I'll come back if my parents have the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  isn't bad, especially if you're hungry for  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>  or any of their many selections.
Eating at Benedict's made me feel like having brunch at my favorite aunt's house. The  <START:A_Places> place <END>  was homey, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was warm and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was comforting. The  <START:A_Places> place <END>  was small and only had a few small  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were some  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  that offered  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  for larger groups. I can easily understand if  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would take a while to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  on a busy day. Good thing (or unfortunately) we got to Benedict's a little past  <START:Food> lunch <END>  already. We immediately got a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and we were greeted as soon as we went through the door. I don't think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a lot of  <START:S_Staff> servers <END> . Take note of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  when you visit  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  when  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's busy. I would think  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  would scramble to make sure  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  is helped and taken cared of. As I've written, the  <START:A_Places> place <END>  felt like home, even my own mom or aunt would have a hard  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  managing several guest at one  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .The  <START:Service> service <END>  was hands-on. The lady who  <START:Service> served <END>  us during our visit was very warm.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was engaging and very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . Again, like what I wrote,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was just like my favorite aunt. I did have some concerns, else I would have  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rated <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  with 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  3  <START:Food> items <END>  from their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  that were not available. Thus, why coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  late might be a disadvantage.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  ran out of  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> , challah  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  for the french  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>  and avocado for the California  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  Benedict. Would have been nice to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out. Maybe i'll come in early the next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  so I get to try what I want.The  <START:Food> food <END>  that were  <START:Service> served <END>  to us was very good. Let me correct that,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very good.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was better than other big  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  brunch  <START:A_Places> places <END>  that I have visited.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was original and full of  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . We had the Arizona  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  benedict and their  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  croissant  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . The croissant  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was soft, airy and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . The additional kick on the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was the pesto  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  nicely and the  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END> , though not as crispy as I wanted had a good  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  as well. My wife loved the Arizona  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  benedict.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had tomatillo  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  instead of the usual hollandaise  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was also a hint of  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  tortilla  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  on the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that gave the  <START:Food> dish <END>  a mexican finish.  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  were poached perfectly and the runny  <START:F_FoodItem> yolk <END>  complimented the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  wasn't bad as well. Not too salty and but had enough kick at the end to tell you that you are eating a  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END> .  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END>  were also very good. Add the warm  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  with good, Benedict's  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  just felt like home.more reviews at http://themealexperience.blogspot.com/
Thin, square (that's their gimmick 'our  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is in a square shape') dry  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> -resteraunt  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  that's forgettable.  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  also uninspired.
Last night I had one of the best  <START:Food> meals <END>  of my life. I found out that Bistro La Bon,  a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I've been wanting to try forever, has a 10 course tasting every Thursday. For $35pp you get 10 amazing courses, bigger  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  than I thought too. The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  is so creative and I think  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is his play  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  puts together  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  you wouldn't think to but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  turn out amazing.I know the first two and last two  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> , but I'm a little uncertain on the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in between.1. Watermelon gazpacho that was unexpectedly (and delightfully) a little spicy2.  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  buffalo mozzarella with heirloom  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END> , micro  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END> , and 12 yr balsamic3. Goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  stuffed peppadew  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  with carmalized  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  and a  <START:F_Ingredients> ginger <END>  honey  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  -  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was a favorite4. Seared  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END>  over mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  with demi glaze- dining partner said  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END>  was perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> .5. Crispy avocado and  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END>  with sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> - another favorite6.  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> - don't remember much about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , I don't like seafood7. Sweedish  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  with ligonberry8. Some kind of cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  whipped cream with ouzi?  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> - really good and very different9. The most amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  with a brie type  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and apricot marmalade that went perfect together10.  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  flourless  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  with mango sorbetThe  <START:Food> food <END>  was just to die for, but also the anticipation of what was coming next was really exciting. I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's different every week.
I have visit alot of mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  especially in US in N.Y and SF. im very picky when  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  comes to  <START:Food> food <END> , because i only want to have the best. <START:A_Decor> decor <END> : very nice, both  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  and exteriorStaff: attentive, but without any smileFood: now the most important of a mexican concept,  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was ok,  <START:F_FoodItem> nacho <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  was very good, Faijtas was also ok. The Guacalole was not good,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was really bad actually.The marguritas was very good.Probably one of the better mexican  <START:A_Places> places <END>  in Edinburgh.
My wife loves  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  regardless of where we are, but I just don't have that same love for Chipotle as  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  does. LOL - Well,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was one down the street from where we were staying last week, so we stopped by for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . Their  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very enthusiastic as  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  greet you with a huge hello, how are ya as soon as you enter the business.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is, of course, the same as all the others, but the black  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  just  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  better than usual, for some reason. I just got the bowl with barbacoa to keep  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  safe because I've been known as a bit of a "Tortilla Snob"...haha, but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  was very, very good. I was absolutely impressed with the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  and will definitely go back the next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we're in  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END>  visiting our daughter!#KudosOnTheEnthusiasm
I like Centurion.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's got more  <START:A_Places> space <END>  now after their expansion, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a quirky, unusual  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .  You feel really  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END> , and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is always good. <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's terrific that after 5pm weekday and all day Saturday and Sunday, street  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  is completely free (so no need to add coins).  Trust me, I live downtown.Their 7 course tasting  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is unbelievably  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  ($50 for  <START:Food> food <END>  only, $75 with  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  pairings).  The 21% gratuity  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  automatically add though is highly annoying (15% is fine, 18% okay, but 21% is a mugging). <START:Service> service <END>  is good.  Their  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>  of the day is unbelievable ($8).   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  make the best  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>  in all of Phoenix, in my opinion, and are creativeTheir  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  are good too, but maybe a dollar or two too  <START:F_FI_Price> expensive <END> .Their mussels are also a standout and fairly  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> .Personally, I'd stick with the three above for an everyday  <START:Food> dinner <END> , and the tasting  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  for a  <START:Offers> special <END>  occasion like an anniversary. Their brunch is also fun.
Disappointment on a tiny  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . I'm giving TPF 3  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  because the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is exceptionally beautiful,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had live Spanish guitar and a flamenco  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> dancer <END>  when I was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and the Sangria is fabulous. The  <START:Food> food <END>  on the other hand , blah. From someone who  <START:S_Staff> cooks <END>  and considers eating a  <START:A_Entertainment> sport <END> , I could totally  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  that many of the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  had been bought pre made and frozen. I'll give a little run down on what we had. <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> - were frozen, par baked like you buy at the  <START:A_LocatedArea> grocery   store   <END>  for Thanksgiving  <START:Food> dinner <END>  but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did come with the most amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  dip.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  called  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  aioli , <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't even  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to an aioli, but delicious all the same.   Almondigas con Tomate - essentially frozen  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  balls sitting in canned spaghetti  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .Tortilla de Patatas -  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  used to make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  - frozen  Pisto gratinado~  <START:F_Ingredients> cauliflower <END>  in Iberico béchamel  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  covered in puff  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END>  - 2nd best  <START:Food> dish <END>  we had. The highlight of the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was an open faced  <START:F_FoodItem> empanada <END>  with roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  and goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . I don't see  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  on the online  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  to get the actual name but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was gooey, garlicy,goat cheesy and I could have eaten 3 of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> . Cava Sangria -  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , tart and a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  deal. The Sangria on  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  own is $8 a glass but by the pitcher  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is only $36. We got 6 full glasses out of the pitcher so you can do the math on the value. We had a few other things but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  weren't  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  mentioning. I'm also not going to go to detailed into the  <START:Service> service <END>  because the  <START:A_Places> place <END>  was packed and had several large parties of self entitled Scottsdaleites blocking the aisles and demanding much more attention than was necessary but I will say  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was about 30 mins before we got our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and over an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  before we got our 1st  <START:Food> dish <END> . The rest came about 25 mins after that. The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was apologetic and we understood that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was more the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  and clientele than  <START:Food> anything <END>  else. I wouldn't go back for the  <START:Food> food <END>  but I would for the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  and the Sangria.
Corner  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is a decent  <START:A_Places> place <END>  to grab a decent  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , and the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are pretty good as well, although  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are other Pizzerias in the city that do give better value for money. However, if you live local, then  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END>  to go to. The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  does not do deliveries, but if you call  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  up you can pre- <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  so that is ready when you get  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .When I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a 12" pepperoni  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was £6, which is pretty good, although the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was more greasy than normal and I used a tissue to absorb areas of excess  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> .The  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  were also pretty  <START:F_FI_Price> expensive <END>  so I decided to go to a local off-license to get a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  instead. Corner  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  also do other  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  as well, such as kebabs,  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and a range of Ben and Jerry  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  creams.
I was tired my child was tired, I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  on the phone to expedite the  <START:Food> meal <END>  to bring home, My child ate at Wendy's right around the corner, I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  my 40 dollars  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END> , gave my name and phone number. I said can you have  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  ready at 8pm.  ¨no problem¨  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said.  ha ha ha I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  like a dope til 8pm because my kid ate and we were done by 7:35. I walked in at 8pm and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said ¨my name¨ I was thinking wow !   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said okay ¨We make  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  now" OMG  I would give  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  zero  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  but I can't. I still want to try one thing on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  i never tried anywhere else sounds good, but I refuse.  I never see anyone in the  <START:A_Places> place <END>  I pass  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  daily. laundering money? hm
We meet  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  every Wednesday and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's always awesome. Megan is a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  and I love the Big Daddy  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> !
Hooray! We finally made  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  felt as though we were in Downtown Phoenix again due to the hip and locally owned feel. I wish  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  could be SO many more  <START:A_Places> places <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  in the  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END> .The  <START:A_LocatedArea> building <END>  is small and charming. You can certainly tell a lot of love and effort were put into making  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  a success.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:Food> breakfast <END> ,  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and  <START:Food> dinner <END> . Have  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> 's,  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> 's,  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and hard  <START:F_Drinks> liquor <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's small inside with about 6  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  with  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  around  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  as well. Cute  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  with umbrellas  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> .Multiple  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  options available! I had the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END> -Tarian  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> . Seems like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have varied  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  options and  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  that change from day to day. The  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . 32 has done amazingly with a concept that is very difficult for  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> ... To excel at ALL 3  <START:Food> meals <END> , keep up  <START:S_Menu> variety <END> , have a spectacular  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , innovative  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , and now have a full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  as well.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is even a drive through  <START:A_Furniture> window <END> ! I felt right at home and cannot  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to come back for some  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> . The  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list looked extensive and varied. Keep supporting local and get  <START:Restaurant> here <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's amazing. I kind of want to live in a little loft above  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .
I love  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> . We try and go every other week. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is a little slow but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> . I have been to several Thai  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  from NYC to CA and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  one is in my top 3 for sure!
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a brand new  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> . I was excited to see that  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's now open. The  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  has a cool bistro  <START:A_Decor> theme <END> . I sat on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  with my bike because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no  <START:S_Parking> bike rack <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are a lack of bike racks at the Arizona Center, in general. But back to the  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good. I had trouble deciding what to try. I had a  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was ok, but next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I would try an actual  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> entree <END> . My friend said the  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END>  was really good.  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are medium ranged. Similar to those of Paradise Bakery, one of their competitors I would assume. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .
I love  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's right next to my house! I brought so many friends and family over  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ! I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  to go almost every week! Stuff is always nice and happy to see you:) I recommend to check  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's good for 2 or big party!!!!
 <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  is mind-blowing. Awesome home- <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  style Brazilian  <START:Food> food <END>  at an affordable  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> . Perfectly grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  vegetarian options, and savory smoothies (try the mango!) Don't get discouraged by the long cooking  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  - the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> / <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  is making  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  a la  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  in the back.  <START:Restaurant>   this    <START:A_Places> place <END>  <END>  is simply glorious. To add even more to the proverbial pie, the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  gave us bowls of what I can only describe as the best lentil  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  I've ever had, on the house, because of the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a gem that should not be ignored!
Awful awful  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> ! An insult to  <START:F_Ingredients> chinese <END> /asian  <START:Food> cuisine <END> ! Seriously! I figured, since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was featured in the  <START:F_Ingredients> chinese <END>  newspaper,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  must somehow represent what we eat... but no... Not one  <START:Food> dish <END>  was acceptable.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a thailand style  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , which in my opinion should be made with something along mango,  <START:F_Ingredients> papaya <END> , sweet and spicy... but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was chop suey with  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and tiny bit of  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> ! the  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was all breading, goey sticky starchy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ,  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END> , too sweet.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  available even though  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is one of their most marketed  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Food> item <END> . And the  <START:Service> service <END>  was beyond bad. Even though  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is a all you can eat, after  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  seem to try to ignore you as much as possible as soon as you try to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  something else. We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for a second round, abandonned and asked for the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> . Surprisingly, the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  came in fast enough.  I really do not recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  at all.
I just can't say I was that impressed. Nice big  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  and decent  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  took a really long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to come out and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  just wasn't that  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> .
Outstanding!  Wonderful  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END> , and  <START:Service> service <END> !  My husband and I frequently  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  and enjoy trying local  <START:A_Places> places <END>  and we are so pleased that we came  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  and when we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was honest and told us we could  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  and relax a little so the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  could catch up!  We went for a relaxing evening and that definitely started  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  -  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  offered  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  input for various  <START:Food> items <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  based on what we said we like.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was top notch -  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to perfection, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  gidori was delicious.  We shared an upside down  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> pistachio <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END> -cream, yummy.  All courses were  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  was very reasonable for the  <START:Food> food <END>  we received.  The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  was cozy and sophisticated.  We highly recommend trying  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  - we will go back !
Worst  <START:Service> service <END>  ever.The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  is NOT  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , okay some  <START:A_Places> places <END>  aren't  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  but AT LEAST  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  GOOD. LOTS AND LOTS OF  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  in their  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> .The  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  don't want to be  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and don't know how to handle large groups.Overall, I would never return.
Unbelievably delicious  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . The value  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  little gem offers is fantastic- Thai  <START:Food> cuisine <END>  to the delicious  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> .We came during the week and had outstanding  <START:Service> service <END>  and a terrific  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wrap <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> ginger <END>  kicked  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  off and we had a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  all the way through to the  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  eye finish! And if the  <START:Food> meal <END>  itself was not even enough don't leave with out a pot of  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and a Thai  <START:F_FoodItem> sundae <END> ! Don't be scared the hot  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  makes  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  Give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a shot you are gonna love  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !
Very unethical and no integrity.  Went in with a comp.  Asked  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  accept  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  told me yes and i  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and ate.   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  told me the computer will not accept  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  dont accept the comps anymore.  Got  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said same thing.  I told  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  why should i  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for your  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  mistake?   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said sorry, but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  cant do  <START:Food> anything <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  cant discount my  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> .  Nice.  What that tells me is if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  make a mistake i will  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  If the  <START:Food> food <END>  is cold, if  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  takes an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> , if  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  burnt... you will still  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  or  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  When you have so many  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  in  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END>  (and aria as well), why go  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ?
I am angry  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  drove out Teakwoods...  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a convenient  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>   <START:Ambience> spot <END> , so my husband and I were hoping at least a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  new  <START:A_Places> place <END>  drove away our favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and  <START:A_Entertainment> sports <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  No.  The  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  were too lazy to change the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was dark and weird and confused.  The  <START:A_Places> space <END>  is underutilized, the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  had no direction, and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was awful.  The entire  <START:A_Places> place <END>  lacks both concept and execution. We will not be returning, and are sad to have lost  a  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>  gem.
I wish I could  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  higher. Along with most of you, I love supporting local  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  and businesses - especially if  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  joint. However, while the  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent, nothing about my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  really stood out. Walking in, my friend and I were the only ones in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , except for one person  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  at the counter about to leave. I wasn't sure whether the lack of customers was because the  <START:Food> food <END>  was bad or simply because  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was late morning on a Thursday. I ended up getting the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  sliders, due to many good reviews of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on yelp. Yes the  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , and yes  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were good. But overall, the  <START:Food> dish <END>  was just meh. My  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  was super oily and the  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  were underseasoned. As for my  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ? Super burnt, which is usually a huge indicator that  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just been sitting on the warmer for quite some  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was completely and utterly undrinkable. Sad to say, I probably wouldn't recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Ambience> spot <END>  next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  my friends and I are trying to find somewhere to eat. But, if any of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  want to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , I wouldn't be opposed to giving  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a second chance.
If you like  <START:Food> food <END>  that's been dropped on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  to you anyways then  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the  <START:A_Places> place <END>  to go otherwise the  <START:Food> food <END>  is really good.
Confession  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . Authentic Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:A_Places> places <END>  intimidate me. I am very interested in trying out new things but rarely do because of the language barrier. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  at  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  are the nicest most helpful  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  I have ever had at an 'over the counter'  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . My first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  in  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  took the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to explain the entire  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and let me sample all the different  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . I settled on soyrizo.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is excellent. As a confused white  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  I think of  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  as a chipotle style  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  with real Mexican  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END> . I make a point to stop by and try something new whenever I am on the east side.
Came to Carmines for a business  <START:Food> dinner <END> . We had a large group and the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  was really  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  about changing our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  as our party  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  increased. We sat near the back and could watch as the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  brought out the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  for other  <START:Food> diners <END>  and man just like the reveiws say -  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are huge! I've been to other family style  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  (bucca or maggianos) and I think Carmines is way better than both of those. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Carmines  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and anti  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  to start. Then our  <START:F_FoodItem> mains <END>  were  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  in red  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , veal parm, and broccoli and  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  rigatoni in white  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all really  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> - i especially liked the veal parm. For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  we had the titanic and choc  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END> . All in all a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  - had  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  flowing and good fun.  I do have to mention  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  that sings  <START:Food> italian <END>  opera -- AMAZING.   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was singing happy birthday to a few folks and came over and sang our group a different song.  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was super nice and  <START:S_Staff> he <END> 's really good! Go see him for yourself!!!
Absolutely fantastic!  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , unique and tons of  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> ...kids loved  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  too. Definitely making  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  a regular stop.
Very quiet over  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> . Was exactly what I was looking for too. However I hope  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  aren't relying on their  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  for business, because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's lacking. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> . $8.10 for  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  and brown  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> . Ladies working were super nice and I enjoyed their company while sitting at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . I'll be back. Super spicy just the way I like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !!!
Good  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ;  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  marinate cheaper, tougher cuts of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  & make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  good by charcoal grilling. The side of  <START:F_Ingredients> cauliflower <END>  was excellent. We enjoyed the skirt and hanger  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> . The Caesar  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was good but  the  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END>  did not  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  in  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was the ditziest I have ever experienced..every 3rd word was yummie..gr8 English vocabulary  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  had, dah..poor vegas education or just an absolute ditz. When we asked about the sides..well,  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  comment was  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are all so awesome & yummie with no description of any. We finally got  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  as we finished our  <START:Food> entrees <END> . The Tuscan  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was the saltiest I have ever had..absolutely inedible.  We will  return for the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  & sides.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are quite disorganized with so many  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  that are poorly trained or just poorly educated young kids. Poor on the  <START:Service> service <END>  side. Definitely not even  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to T Bones in Red Rock. The  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  in the butcher  <START:Restaurant> shop <END>  are off the chart  <START:F_FI_Price> expensive <END>  &  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  raise the per lb  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  almost every day. No way is a lousy tough NY strip  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  $27./lb.  The whole carcusses are hanging in their  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>  as are 2 whole headless pigs and their heads are on the top shelf. That is enough to turn anybody off. Very attractive  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  but extremely loud with marble-like hard  <START:A_Places> floors <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is on the 2nd  <START:A_Places> floor <END> . Nice  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>  dining if  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is not too hot outdoors.
Relatively new local joint  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to home.  Nice  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  on the inside!  Very clean.   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was good, but not  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> .  Now on to the  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> .  B and G  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  Carne asada  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  were ok.   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was good.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  a good  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of local micro brews.  Need to come back for some 'shine and copper mule!  Nice  <START:A_Places> place <END> ,  we will be back.
Finally got  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> , heard about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  from my friends many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> ! The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is good,  <START:A_Environment> environment <END>  is not bad, doesn't feel like those typical Japanese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , I definitely will come back again!! Had a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> !! Love  <START:Restaurant> it <END> ..!!!
I ate  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  last night.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was better than when we tried to go when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  first  <START:S_OpenHours> opened <END>  - too crowded, not enough  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  eye  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was so so. The  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  was just  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  and some  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> , nothing to write home about. Will go again try something different, to get my final opinion of  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> 
Today was my fourth visit and probably my last visit. I was extremely happy the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  because I'm from Chicago and grew up on Al's on (Taylor). Anyway, the  <START:Food> food <END>  was delicious. I think I even wrote a good review the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . However the second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went I was disappointed the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was luke warm and  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were kinda salty but still had  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . Third visit went the same way, so I thought to myself maybe I'm going to often and my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  buds are getting use to the  <START:Food> food <END> . Well today I went after about 2 months and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was the same type of  <START:Food> food <END>  but worse. The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was cold, the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  well I'll just say I had  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  with my  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was ridiculous. I got upset because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's pretty pricey. I don't want to ruin what I grew up on so I'll  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go to a Chicago to have Al's on Taylor. I gave  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  3  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  because the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is always nice, the  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  remembered me big plus because I love  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  customer  <START:Service> service <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is always clean and the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was good. I suggest getting a different warmer for the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and tell your  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  easy with the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> .
I stopped in for a  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  and was favorably impressed by the  <START:A_Places> place <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a nice, clean, well- <START:A_Decor> lit <END>  dining  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> .  The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for  <START:Service> service <END> .  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the half  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and cornbread.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was a nice combination of  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  greens.  The cornbread was a huge chunk that could easily have been shared among 4  <START:Food> diners <END> .  The reason I'm giving  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  only a 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  rating is that the chunky pot roast  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was too salty for me.  When my  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  checked back with me I told  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  about the  <START:F_FI_Taste> saltiness <END> .   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  apologized and offered to bring a bowl of their  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  instead.  That was too salty for me as well.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  may be that I'm just too sensitive to  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> .  Whatever,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were very accommodating and asked what  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  could offer instead.  Since I'd pigged out on all that  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and the yummy  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , I was no longer hungry.  So  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  took the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  of the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  off my  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> .  I don't consider my personal sensitivity to  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  to be any fault of my  <START:S_Staff> server <END> .  Accordingly, I added the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  of the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  to  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  tip.  I was a satisfied customer when I left, and I'll definitely be back to try something from their  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .
So bomb the dim sum option is on point like seriously. Recommend  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  for those craving Asian  <START:Food> food <END>  on a budget. I will definitely come back for sure ;)
The pan fried dumplings and a  <START:F_Drinks> milk <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  boba  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  were my Christmas  <START:Food> dinner <END> . I wish I had chosen more wisely. We came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  after wandering the strip because I was cold and starving and just couldn't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  any longer for  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't bad.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was actually pretty good.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just way more  <START:F_FI_Price> expensive <END>  than  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:Worthiness> worth <END> . My  <START:Food> meal <END>  was $22 which is ridiculous for those two  <START:Food> items <END> . I got 6 dumplings. For that, I should have gotten more dumplings or 6 with more exotic  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  than just  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> . $13 is appropriate for 6 dumplings if  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're made of ostrich or Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> . The three  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  are because my boyfriend had an amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ...a little more  <START:F_FI_Price> expensive <END>  than the  <START:Food> food <END>  truck ($8) but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was ok because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's something I can't recreate by myself, decent  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  and you can't get  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  just anywhere. I don't know specifically which one  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  had, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was absolutely delicious. 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for fukuburger just by itself. The dumplings weren't bad but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  weren't outstanding either. Just average. I encourage you to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  if you're curious about FAME, but I'll never come back for  <START:Food> anything <END>  else.
A bit overpriced, but for being part of the new downtown summerlin, I can see how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  want to cater for a certain  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END> .Came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for an office  <START:Food> lunch <END> , we made  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  for 10. Even though we had a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  and made  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , we still had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  20mins. Not too bad, but you would think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  ready for a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  beforehand. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was OK, I had better. I feel  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was somewhat plain with the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  only  <START:A_Entertainment> showing <END>  the 'standard'  <START:Offers> specials <END> . Like spicy crunch  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> ...etc. nothing too fancy that can be seen as signature. As for the  <START:Food> entrees <END> , we had a bunch of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> , standard BLT,  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , etc. the the Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was the most fancy one. I personally had the sautéed Norwegian  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  was tender, flavorful, but not dry. The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was creamy and perfectly paired with the  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> . I recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  100%. For  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  alone, I would come back, my husband likes classic  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  so  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  is good with that.The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is nice, very modern, suiting the overall  <START:A_Environment> setting <END>  of the mall. Only visited during  <START:Food> lunch <END> , so we'll see how  <START:Food> dinner <END>  will be. Perhaps I'll update the review when we have done so with my  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> , didn't know the  <START:Offers> specials <END> , again, went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  opening week, so I'm sure  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was new.
