I've travel 52 weeks per year. I grew up in Pittsburgh, lived in Chicago for 5 years came back this year.  Been to Italy, New York...Fiori's is the best.   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is great,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  is great,  <START:Service> service <END>  is always friendly and entertaining.  I have been going  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for 20 years.

After driving by everyday for months I finally stopped in for a  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  and was  <START:O_Experience> completely unimpressed <END> . Even though the shop was nearly empty, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was indifferent and they forgot what I ordered multiple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> .The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  parm  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  I ordered was a hot bland mess. Instead of  <START:F_Ingredients>   crispy   breaded   chicken   <END>  inside, it had plain unseasoned  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  slices which was covered in  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and a  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  one step away from  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END> . To top it all off the  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> microwaved <END> , which made the inside insanely hot and turned to  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  to rubber.Maybe their  <START:F_FI_Size> regulars <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> subs <END>  are better, but the next time I spend $10 on a  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> , it definitely won't be  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .

The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , perfectly reasonable.  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is convenient, especially if you're catching a flick nearby. The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is about what you'd expect: Not  <START:Food> stellar <END> , but not horrible either. It's on the pricey side, but you probably know that already. It takes  <START:W_Price> money <END>  to keep the engine running.What is really bad is the  <START:Service> service <END> . Well, that's not entirely true. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is actually friendly - very much so, in fact. They  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  you, and  <START:A_Furniture> seat <END>  you fairly promptly (at the appropriate  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> ), keep your  <START:F_Drinks> beverages <END>  filled, clear  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> , just about everything.But the wait for the  <START:Food> food <END>  is absolutely ridiculous. Not one of those "where is the  <START:Food> food <END> " moments, but about ten of them, back to back, and it's not just when they are busy - even when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is empty, it takes forever to be served. It could be blamed on the freshness of the  <START:Food> food <END> , but we're talking even  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and fairly simple  <START:F_FoodItem> stir fry <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END> , so this isn't rocket science.Or perhaps it is and all those other Chinese places just do it better.

This is where I had the best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  of my life. It is hands down one of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  houses in the city, in any city. The  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  is always amazing, which it should be because it will  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  you. That is the only down side but you truely get what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for at this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and I believe it is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it everytime.Go and enjoy because you will be speaking about it for days, months, and years... seriously =)

Always good- the  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Size> generous <END>  and flavorful. The veal  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are very  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  without being heavy. Cappachio chilled ,  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I think this is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to meet friends or bring out of towners. I have been a fan of Chef Nina and her  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  for many many years.

Fantastic  <START:Food> food <END> , great  <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> live music <END> , locally owned. This is our favorite spot to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  for sure.

Well, i think i'm one of a hand full of ladies who actually like  <START:Restaurant> hooters <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .  so my boyfriend took myself and another couple  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for my birthday  <START:Food> dinner <END>  , one of my 4 night stay in vegas (@ treasure island)we also wanted to see  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> .. not that  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  anyway..The  <START:Food> food <END>  was okay, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was awful, of all the  <START:Restaurant> hooters <END>  i've been to this is the worst by far. And you'd think its be the BEST since its  <START:Restaurant> in   there   <END>   <START:Restaurant> hotel <END> / <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> .. not the case.

I've been coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for about five years and today was my last day. I sat down and pulled out my e-cigarette as I have been doing for the past three years. I ordered a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . I decided on my usual and placed my order. When the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  came back, she said I was not allowed to use my e-cigarette  <START:Restaurant> in   there   <END> . As per the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> , "E-cigarettes are no longer allowed but cigarettes and cigars are." When I first started coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , I was a smoker! The  <START:Food> food <END>  is great and they have a nice  <START:F_Drinks> draught <END>  selection. I have nothing against smoke or smokers, obviously because this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has tons of smokers who are usuals. I really liked the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  too! The low ceilings combined with the  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>  smokers makes for a vintage Vegas  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  that you really can't find much these days.Don't try to apply logic  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . It really makes no sense. I honestly think someone could get away with smoking a joint in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is that much smoke. Make sure you don't bring your electronic cigarette though, you could fill those with  <START:F_Ingredients> cannabis <END> ! The ironic part is that  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a sign out front that says ' <START:A_Plc_SmokingArea> smoker friendly <END> .'If the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  banned cigarettes AND e-cigarettes, that would somewhat make sense, but I STILL wouldn't go back. At least he was being consistent.Do not go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to watch Buckeyes  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>  either, they will yell at you for being loud when you are just cheering. I can't speak for Browns  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>  on Sunday though. The local Buckeye  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is now PT's Gold on Rainbow anyway and has been for several years now.Pros: Very smokey, like Jazz pool-hall it has that smokey-blue tinge in the right  <START:A_Decor> light <END> .The usuals are all great!The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is fantastic!Cons:No electronic cigarettes.

Excellent  <START:Food> food <END>  at great  <START:W_Price> prices <END> . I hadnt been  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  in years but found it again this past weekend and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is still just as good as ever and the  <START:Food> portions <END>  are just as gigantic as ever. Also one of the few places that still have Stuffed Hot Banana Peppers. If you get the  <START:F_FoodItem>   crab   balls <END> , order them with the honey mustard dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .

The Giant Carumba  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  for $5.95 are you kidding me, this is 3  <START:Food> meals <END>  for me.  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  takes up the entire  <START:S_Cutlery> aluminum tin <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Even though it is huge still has good  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , I get the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and it is served wet in the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Also comes with  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and has a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  good  <START:F_FoodItem>   salsa     bar   <END> .You order at the counter and they call your number to pick up the  <START:Food> food <END> . If you are looking for a fast  <START:F_FI_Price> inexpensive <END>  good  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  clean Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , this is it, They do live up to their motto "Where you don't PESO much!"For the  <START:W_Price> money <END>  you spend and the  <START:Food> food <END>  you get it is a 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> , but 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  is an over the top  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for me.Use to go to the one in Glendale, but with work have been coming for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to the one on Bell Road. Same good  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END> 

Premium  <START:Food> food <END>  mixed with daily  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END> . Definitely a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to check out.

My absolute favorite  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> .  Unless you are in a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  group  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is never more then a 10 minute wait, even on Sunday morning when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  appears to be packed.Friendly  <START:Service> service <END> , and the pumpkin  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  is to die for.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  have been  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  I was tempted to stop in just to buy a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of the pumpkin  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  to go. The  <START:F_FoodItem> omelets <END>  are huge, consider sharing if you aren't a heavy eater. Never had anything other then  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  so not sure how the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  is.

The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is awesome...like, seriously awesome. I've tried several of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and haven't had a bad  <START:Food> meal <END>  yet.  Also awesome: the wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . I find that  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in Las Vegas its hard to find good  <START:Service> service <END>  (which is odd because I would have thought the opposite) so I love coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  in because its always a very pleasant  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Ask for Anthony or Don they are both fantastic and friendly  <START:S_Staff> servers <END> . The only reason I gave  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END>  instead of 5 is because their  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining rooms <END>  are extremely crowded when busy and it feels very claustrophobic in those situations. It won't stop me from going back though!

I didn't know  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was so many different   <START:F_FoodItem> cheeses <END>  to put on my Philly  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END> , he asked me what kind of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  I wanted I was lost I said "Philly  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> " lol but on the real I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . the corner  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  scares me with so much speeding traffic i always think about a car or truck crashing into people trying to enjoy this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  be safe...

 <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  rare ordered....well done received. Disappointing for a $50 plus  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  I don't send  <START:Food> food <END>  back to the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> , it frightens me. Slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  will be ordered in a bit.

A great steakhouse amongst the excess of options that Vegas provides. We arrived at 7 on a Thursday and had  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> , though the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was not busy enough to require them. I ordered the filet mignon,  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> , and my wife ordered the prime rib, also  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> . Both were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly, and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was extremely high.For sides we had the yukon gold puree, very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> green beans <END> , also very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . They have a great  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  selection, some nice house  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  (I had the Fire and  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  I believe it was called, a fun mix of  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapenos <END> ), and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was great.The only downside was the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> / <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . The entrance is directly from the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>  floor, which I tend to like the  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  set back more from the crowds, but once we were in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  far back inside, and it was nice and quiet.Overall, a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat for a nice  <START:Food> meal <END>  with amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END> . Would definitely go back

I am a prime  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  steakhouse lover! I consider myself an expert in the craft. I have had them all. Flemings, Mortons, Donovans, Ruth Chris ehhh. None compare to Del Friscos! The  <START:Food> portions <END>  are huge and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> ! The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  are second to none! Whenever I stay at the Hard Rock, I make it a point to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ?By far the best  <START:Service> service <END> !

We went to Roy's on the advice of a friend and were  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> ! The Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  was "melt-in-your-mouth" amazing and the Mai Tais were yummy!   Hard to believe that this is a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> !  The  <START:Food> cuisine <END>  was not " <START:F_FI_Taste> vanilla <END> " and  <START:Service> service <END>  was outstanding!

My friend and I stopped  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> .  We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  immediately, and the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very nice and prompt with  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  refills.  They have a huge range of options for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> , and almost everything is made  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , not  <START:F_FI_Quality> boxed <END>  or  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frozen <END> , which is always a plus.  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Apple Compote  <START:F_Ingredients> waffle <END> , and the  <START:F_Ingredients> waffle <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> honey butter <END>  was amazing.  I'd probably go back to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for the  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  looking, fluffy  <START:F_FoodItem> pankcakes <END>  or some homemade pie.

Nothing out of this world... 1/2 of our 10  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  was pretty burnt and undersized. The other  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  of our order was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  properly and we enjoyed it.However, the  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  was very unprofessional during our visit and spoke to me and other customers as if he was hanging out with his buddies, rather than  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  customers.

Pancake  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  holds a  <START:O_Experience> special <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in my heart, I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and tried the famous  <START:F_FoodItem> apple pancake <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem>   bacon   pancakes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pumpkin pancakes <END> , and lately I've been really in love with their  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END> .  They also have  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> thick cut <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> . I'm surprised people don't like the  <START:F_FoodItem> pumpkin pancakes <END>  because my boyfriend is crazy about them and gets them every time. Speaking of my boyfriend, we went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on our first date.  To the Yelp-er who said that this is where people take their one night stands... almost fell off my  <START:A_Furniture> chair <END>  laughing at that one.  We went back for our 1 year anniversary, we'll be back for number 2.  :)My one caution is that yes, it is as ridiculously crowded as everyone says it is, so be prepared to wait or go on an week day.

Fun spot for  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  and a  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> .  Interesting scene.

I really really don't get the hype over Nobu. Yeah, the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is beautiful, the presentation of the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great, it's always filled with fun people and it's in the Hard Rock  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  (one of my favorite hotels in Vegas)...BUUUUUUUUUUUT the  <START:Food> food <END>  is waaay overrated. I'm Japanese so I think I have a pretty good idea of what good Japanese  <START:Food> food <END>  is. This wasn't it. Sorry.

Still the best  <START:Food> buffet <END>  I've been to.  Of course, you have to keep in mind that's it's a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  so for the peeps expecting a 3-Michelin  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , you will be disappointed.  The only complaint I have is that a year later, the Wynn  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is still  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  the same  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  (and  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> !) are still  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> !

I really dont know how people  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  this  <START:Food> buffet <END>  so high. 1. Its was $50 for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  because of 18% gratuity2. the  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  were mostly dry, they had  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> sausage <END>  at the carving station and they were dry as can be.  Tell me how can  <START:F_Ingredients> sausage <END>  be dry???3. was not  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with the selection at all, all their  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  said Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  but who care if it  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  bad and plus its American Kobe which isn't real Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> . 4. the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  was okay,  <START:F_Dessert>   ice   cream <END>  was good 5. so overrated for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> , just a tourist trap6. better going to a sit down  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END> .I felt raped by the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  to  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .never again do a Vegas  <START:Food> buffet <END> , I always used to love  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  when I was younger but the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  now a days just doesn't justify going to one. Better  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END>  at a sit down  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Plus do a free walk around before you decide all  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  let you do this before buying it.

Best  <START:F_FoodItem> barbeque <END>  around, great  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and excellent  <START:Service> service <END> . Could use better  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  makes up for it.

Nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to hang out and have a  <START:F_Drinks> drank <END>  on,  <START:A_Ent_Music> karaoke <END> , Dj with  a  <START:A_Entertainment> dance floor <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staffs <END>  are awesome! The sig sig is out of this world

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is absolutely horrible! 1 the  <START:Service> service <END>  is just horrible, our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  practically ignored us all night with our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  empty and we had to ask her multiple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  to get refills. 2 we ordered our  <START:Food> food <END>  and it took forever to come out. I mean like 40 min with only 2  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  next to us and others dancing so that has absolutely no excuse for the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  to be taking so long to make our  <START:Food> food <END> . 3 when we try to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  our  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  (which was only 38 dollars) I only had a 50 which is relatively close to the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  and our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  said they didnt have change in the drawer, I mean its a 12 dollar change!!! What kind of a restraunt doesnt have 12 dollars change in the  <START:W_Price> cash <END>  drawer?!?!? Well thats my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and it was absolutely fucking horrible. I wish I could put zero stars.

$24.99 for  <START:Food> brunch <END> .    <START:Food> food <END>  was soso, I expect much better from Mandalay Bay...

The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is mediocre.Not bad, but not super good. If you're a foodie, you will have to choose wisely. Not everything in the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is good, but you must pick and choose.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are some diamonds  <START:Restaurant> in   there   <END> .My husband and I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on a Friday for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  a few months ago. We had scored BOGO tickets for our  <START:Food> meal <END> . The  <START:Food> meal <END>  was a GREAT deal! For the two of us (for a  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END> ), we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $23 total. I would definitely come back to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in a heart beat. The value was phenomenal for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> . But of course for the next time I'd do the same thing, pick out the  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  things (and trust me,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are some- including yummy Lox!) out of the sea of mediocre  <START:Food> food <END> .

Was turned onto this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  by a friend. When you walk in, you get this Truck Stop, dirty, dingy type of a feel. This has never scared me because most of the  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , these places have the best  <START:Food> food <END> ! (Check out Polaris  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  behind the Rio All-Suites  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  and  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> ! Best  <START:Food> breakfast <END> !)Sat down and everything appears to be a tad old and run down. But, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was pretty decent. You could tell these people aren't corporate, and I don't mind that at all. I ordered the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , wet (with  <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ) and  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  with hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and the other  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END> . I like my  <START:Food> food <END>  hot and this was HOT!!! At first I thought I wasn't going to be able to handle, but then I adapted. LIke I said, I like my  <START:Food> food <END>  HOT!!The  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  as if it were prepared by someone who knows Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> , and not by someone trained to  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cook <END>  and emulate it. My overall  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was that even thought it aint the prettiest or cleanest  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  more than makes up for it. I say at least give it a shot and judge for yourself. Will I eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again? As Dave Hester would say..."YUUUP!"

The real deal!  Great  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , true  <START:Food> diner <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . Can't ask for more.

Back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again with my monthly ladies'  <START:Food> lunch <END>  group. I ordered the  <START:Food> lunch <END>  combo: 1  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , and a  <START:F_Drinks> tropical   ice     tea   <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  noodle  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  today, it was loaded with  <START:F_Ingredients> goodies <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> onions <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> celery <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and lots of noodles). The  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was good, not too salty. I ordered the pepperoni  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Unfortunately, it is on the extra  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  side. The tip of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was a black and the crust was super  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> . I did not attempt to eat the crust, way too hard. It was better last time. The  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and nonstop flowing of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  was good. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is always excellent.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has the best  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ! The people are usually nice & helpful.  We live near Nellis AFB so this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  isn't close to us but we come on this side of town just for the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> !  Wish they would open up a shop over close to us!  That would be awesome! (Hint, hint) ;)

Omfg diablo  <START:Food> hot   wing   <END>  challenge is not a joke, they use  <START:F_Ingredients> ghost chilli extract <END> , warning do not do challenge my tongue, throat, cheek and ears went numb and no I did not finish the 20  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  only ate 15  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  ....

Winner winner Tuna melt sammich. They use albacore white, Swiss  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  on a  <START:F_Ingredients> soft heated bun <END> .  It was Earlicius!!! Sorry no pics, scarfed that bad boy down.  It was also a really good  <START:Food> portion <END> , not gijimbo just right.

Sure, Vegas has some of the best  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in the world. So when you want something fast,  <START:W_Price> cheap <END> , and easy, shouldn't it still be at the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  you expect? That's what I found at Earl of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . Not just a  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , but a low  <START:W_Price> price <END>  hot  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  gourmet grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END> . I had the chipotle  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> avocado <END> , and it was far more than I expected. It was not the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  I've ever had in my life, but it was absolutely  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> , quick, and  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  for about $6. If you don't want to blow a ton of  <START:W_Price> money <END>  on a quick  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat and you'd rather spend it in the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> , then grab a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  from the Earl.

This was easily one of the best  <START:Food> meals <END>  I have ever had, the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was awesome. Just an all around great dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . GET THE  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  FOR  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> !!!

Consistently excellent!  Had  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  last night and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was superior,  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent as well.  We come to the  <START:A_LocatedArea> marketplace <END>  often and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is always beautifully presented and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is consistent.  Well done, we will continue to come back!

I visited this little jewel when it first opened and bought six  <START:Food> pastries <END>  to take to a friends  <START:Food> luncheon <END> . I was really disappointed and never went back. Three years later, looking for a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  near my home, I stumbled upon Scratch again, this time to rave reviews. I decided to give it another chance and get actual  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and I am so glad that I did! I chose the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  Benedict with ham (I will try the  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked duck <END>  next time). This is the first  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in Phoenix/Scottsdale to get hollandaise right (they make their own), the poached  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  were perfection. Now, I normally get really irritated at a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  on a plate of great  <START:Food> food <END>  as an afterthought. At first, I ignored it and dove into the actual  <START:Food> food <END>  that I ordered. I decided to use it as a  <START:F_FoodItem> palate cleanser <END>  but then I couldn't stop eating it! No "afterthought" sides for Scratch!  My husband said the hash browns were the best ever and I agree. They are  <START:Offers> seasoned <END>  with maybe  <START:F_Ingredients> fennel <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> rosemary <END> ?  I was full so I had to get my  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  to go. The  <START:F_Dessert> salted caramel <END>  is just like butta!!  I would love to keep this little  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to myself but it wouldn't be fair to the rest of humanity.

Everyone at our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  (4  <START:S_Staff> guys <END> ) all had different  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> entres <END> . Needless to say, all of us raved about our  <START:Food> meals <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  we had, I believe his name was Matt was fantastic with his  <START:Service> recommendations <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> . If I stay at Palms again, I would return for sure.

I go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  frequently because it's only a couple miles from my work and much better than the nearby Souper  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . I usually order a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  caesar or salmon  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is flavorless and  <START:F_FI_Price> costs <END>  extra, but without it I'd probably still feel hungry after. I noticed that when I first started going earlier this year they filled the bowl to the top with  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> , but now it seems like they only fill it  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  way. I like that you tell them what  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  you want instead of your typical  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  where you always wonder who touched or sneezed on the  <START:Food> food <END> . They chop your  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  which is very nice. The  <START:A_Decor> dressings <END>  are good, but unless you like a ton of dressing make sure you tell them you only want a little because they put a lot on. They also have a punch card and punch it 2  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  if you get a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  (only  <START:F_FI_Price> costs <END>  $1 more), or 1 time if you get a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Overall it's an OK  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get a  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .

Unless you REALLY have to have a  <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END>  with your  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , I suggest you go to the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .It's not like the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  aren't good.  They're ok, I suppose.  The choices are limited and so are the ' <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> '.   <START:Service> service <END>  is ok but could be improved.  My husband liked it a lot more than I did 'coz we came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  TWICE but it's just a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  to me.  Nothing out of the ordinary nor gourmet about it.  I miss  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> !!

Great vegetarian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is great and diverse, and is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  very close to McGill. I really enjoyed eating  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ; however it is very popular and is often crowded. On the plus side, you can make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> .

The  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  was similar to what I have experienced at many other steakhouses.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is way  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is marginal.  We went for the 45 dry aged Porterhouse  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and it arrived  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  very well but lacking in seasoning and all of the character you come to expect and  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for in a dry aged  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  The sides were very average as well.  The one good thing was the  <START:Service> service <END> .  We had a big group and they handled everything well.  Definitely not the best choice in Montreal.

I went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and will never go back again. I thought the combinations on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  were kind of bizarre- having some  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  on the side- but maybe that's just me, too much carbs and  <START:F_Ingredients> starch <END>  on one plate is kind of off-putting. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  had some choices that sounded good, but that's it. I ordered a 'make your own  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> ', which had penne, mixed  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> , and rose  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . When my  <START:Food> dinner <END>  arrived, it was not what I was expecting. Way too much  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> , and not enough  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> -  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were maybe 2 florets each of  <START:F_Ingredients> broccoli <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cauliflower <END> , and maybe 3 pieces each of red and  <START:F_Ingredients> green peppers <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  didn't even seem  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was doused in  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and was not very pleasant to eat.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was so much  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> , it could have been split between 2-3 people. I noticed all the  <START:Food> food <END>  going out looked like it could have fed that many people. Why make that much  <START:Food> food <END>  for one person? i don't understand. Takeout the rest after maybe, but I certainly didn't want to.The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  was just as bad- I ordered a mousse, which was much too rich, and again  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was too much of it.Despite the gross  <START:Food> food <END> , I think the  <START:Service> service <END>  was good. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was friendly to me, addressing me in English as I was the only anglophone at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . I'd give the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  1.5 stars because of the  <START:Service> service <END> .The  <START:Food> food <END>  is memorable, but for all the wrong reasons.

Nothing like  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  a Metro.  Typical Scottsdale in trying really hard to impress with a look and not being able to  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END> . Big  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  in the middle seemed like the best  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to sit.  Weird  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  outlined the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with tacky  <START:A_Decor> curtains <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was ok but didn't seem to offer any real interesting or creative touches.  Calamari and  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  were decent but were a little pricey especially for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  Nothing really appealing to draw me back to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .

Awesome  <START:Food> food <END> . Never had a disappointing  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  item. Seitan  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are as good or better than the real thing! Great take-out spot.

I'm under the impression that Ohana Hawaiian BBQ is a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>  in Las Vegas, but you definitely get a completely different  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  at each  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .The Husband ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Katsu and Kalbi  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END>  Combo, while I ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Lau Lau  Their two  <START:F_FI_Size> scoops <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and one scoop of  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  is an embarrassment to Hawaiian  <START:Food> food <END> .  When I opened my box, I thought they were kidding.  What's up with the  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> scoops <END> ?  Definitely disappointing on that part alone.The  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  okay, but my  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was super dry.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were minimal fatty pieces, and everyone knows a good lau lau should have some decent amount of fatty pieces!  <START:Service> service <END>  can be improved  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The only girl working was outside  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> socializing <END>  with some  <START:S_Staff> guys <END> .  I needed more  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  and since they are behind the counter, I had to go outside to request more.  It seemed like I was bothering her.  Overall,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are way better Hawaiian  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Vegas that do better in  <START:Food> food <END>  ( <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> quantity <END> ) and  <START:Service> service <END> .2.5 stars

We stopped in during the festival (make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> !). The  <START:Food> food <END>  was very carefully prepared, and quite nice.  I see one reviewer was concerned that this is a  <START:Restaurant> tapas <END>  establishment (that would be the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  next door). No, this has credible Spanish  <START:Food> food <END> , and a reasonable  <START:S_Menu>   wine   list <END> . A fun evening.

Does Edinburgh really need three branches of I.J. Mellis? If you've sampled the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  they sell, you'll know the answer is YES. Established in 1993, this  <START:A_OutsideView> picturesque <END>  shop is the original I.J. and is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  halfway down the charming Victoria Street in the Old Town. It's tiny compared to delis like Clark's and Valvona & Crolla but they manage to pack a lot of character and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavour <END>  into the  <START:A_Places> space <END> . On a weekend it's usually crammed with tourists ooohing and aaahing at the produce but in the week, its easy to walk in and pick up supplies for a last minute picnic.On those rare occasions, my basket usually includes a campagne  <START:F_Ingredients> loaf <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> rustica olives <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> grilled artichokes <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> parma ham <END> , Montgomery Cheddar, Ragstone goats  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and some Mrs Kirkham Lancashire.

Tried this after the reviews on Yelp.  Had a bit of a Wait on a Saturday morning, but we expect that.  They told us 10-15 minutes, but it actually was more like 25 minutes.  While we were  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  we saw someone slip the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  $20 to skip the line - not cool !  Once  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  (inside as we took first available) our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  came over very quickly and took our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  order and then our full order - we got our  <START:Food> food <END>  very quickly considering how busy it was.  The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very friendly and gave us suggestions on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  since this was our first time  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  I had the Caprese omelet, which was excellent - my partner had the  <START:F_FoodItem> berry <END>  pancakes and said they were good too.  It was a little noisy inside, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent and we will be back.

One of my favorite  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  cafés to visit! This morning our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  DONNA was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and polite. She immediately noticed  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no  <START:F_Ingredients> creamer <END>  left on our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and was quick to bring more for my  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ,she also brought me a new  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END>  right away. It's not easy to find great  <START:Service> service <END>  in a busy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,but I am very pleased with everything  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  including the  <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>  omelet is a fantastic choice! The  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is amazing & they bring you your own pot to pour from instead of having to wait and hope that you'll get a refill. Next time you're hungry for a hearty  <START:Food> meal <END> ,this is the spot!

AMAZING!  My husband and i have been "take out" from  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for the past year.  Always SO relish- and zero mistakes on our order. Always order the Pho  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> - w  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and an order of  spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> .  We decided to stray this week and try recomended Pho Lein which had great reviews.  SUCH a disapointment. When we got home, unwrapped the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  to put into the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  - it was already pre  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> ? UGH. The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was fatty and tasteless. Pho Bac- great  <START:Food> portion <END>  sizes,  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , and delish! Be prepared w/  <START:W_Price> cash <END>  only and time to look for  <START:S_Parking> parking <END> 

This was my first time eating Vietnamese  <START:Food> food <END>  and I wasn't disappointed at all.  My husband ordered an iced  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and I quickly followed suit.  When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.  I am used to very strong  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  so when I go out, it's hard to find  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  that I like but this one was simply amazing.  I decided to try the Pho with  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  and my husband ordered the Pho with  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and tripe.  I loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  leaves that they give you to add to your  <START:Food> meal <END>  and thought the  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END>  was pretty good.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  but the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  weren't that great.  If you decide to order the Pho, I would recommend that you try it with something other than the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END> .  My husband enjoyed his bowl of Pho as well.  We will definitely be going back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  sometime soon!

 <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  Beware can be quite spicy.

Old fashioned  <START:F_FoodItem> hamburger <END> , tortilla  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  walnut  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , wonderful. Give it a try and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  was only 2.50.

It can be lonely being a  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  enthusiast in Waterloo. For six years I've had to endure a city with a makeshift  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  culture. To make matters worse, my Coop terms take me to Seattle and New York to enjoy the best  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  culture around only to yank me back to KW every 4 months.Today I'm enjoying an Americano on King Street in Uptown Waterloo. Any other day I would be at Heuther's or my oh-so-favorite Second  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END> . Not today. On the corner of Dupont & King  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  infusion of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  culture into mundane Uptown life.This new  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  is appropriately called  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  Culture and I have the best  <START:A_Furniture> seat <END>  in the house! It's the  <START:A_Furniture> red   leather   <END>   <START:A_Furniture> couch <END>  in the corner by the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END> . I can see the little old ladies in the street plastering their faces into the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>  wondering what this new  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is. After walking away they are back literally 10 minutes later with their husbands to try it out.  The lineup was short but the wait time was long. The  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  was new so I forgive him. I took in the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  instead. Oddly it's spread out the whole length of the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  making it hard to read everything while standing in line. After ordering and taking my super awesome  <START:A_Furniture> seat <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> barista <END>  came by. She asked me exactly how much  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  I'd like in my Americano. It might not seem like  <START:O_Experience> special <END>  treatment but it is. The last time I had this custom a  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  made for me it was at bauhaus in trendy hipster Seattle.The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are low  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  to fair  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . I have a feeling they will rise to match everyone.  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  shops are always  <START:W_Price> more expensive <END>  to run than initially thought as well. Still, they are definitely competitive with Starbucks, Second  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END> , Heuther  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  and even Timmies. They have plenty of  <START:Food> food <END> . If I had  <START:W_Price> money <END>  to spare I'd try it out. Though, the smell of it is enough to convince me to come back!The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is sparkling clean. Sure to please my parents when they come for a visit. They never did like the grungy hipster makeshift house  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> 's I generally drag them to. The  <START:A_Furniture> couches <END>  are  <START:A_Furniture> leather <END>  and the  <START:A_Furniture> chairs <END>  and  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  real wood - not plasticy Timmies style - though you knew that by now. They even have a nice big screen  <START:A_Ent_Tv> television <END>  so I can enjoy a  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  while getting some work done - free  <START:S_Wifi> wifi <END>  hurrah!Oh look, even a cop walked in to try it out. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is destined for greatness :p So long Timmies and good riddance.One new  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  may not be enough to turn KW into a thriving cosmopolitan city overnight. But with a new  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> , I feel better that  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  enthusiasts in KW aren't a dying species like first thought.

How can somebody who's always had a sweet tooth like me not love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ? I've been telling myself I'll cut back on my sweets intake - it's been a battle that I keep losing. Since this shop is in the same complex as a  Gold's Gym - that's a good enough excuse to indulge in sweet  <START:Service> treats <END> , right?The shop is so cute. Black and white  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  and the  <START:A_Decor> colors <END>  come from the beautiful  <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END> ,  <START:Food> pastries <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  they have. I'm actually wishing my birthday was much sooner so I can get a  <START:F_FoodItem> birthday cake <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . They serve  <START:F_Drinks> hot chocolate <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> milk <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> juice <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> ...and  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  (at night).  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  +  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ? Can I just live  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ? Before I continue, I must say that my love for  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  started when I first had them in Paris - oh l'amour! So, I'm not one of those that eat them because they're trendy or whatever. The fad can die but I'd still love  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> . These French cookies are my faves just like chunky  <START:F_FoodItem> chocolate chip cookies <END> . I'd go to a macaron shop at every city I visit for comparison and get  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  in ALL their  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> . So, I'm glad the Vegas area has Gimme Some  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> . My true test for  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  is pistachio  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  but unfortunately, they didn't have it when I went but I think you can  <START:O_Experience> special <END>  order items a day before.They have 10 macaron  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  at a time. I think 2 are seasonal  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  and 8 mainstays. I've tried 10  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> :  <START:F_FI_Taste> fig & goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , Snickerdoodle,  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  &  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END> , Nutella, PB&J, grandpa's  <START:F_FoodItem> blueberry pancake <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> birthday cake <END> , maple- <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> , Snickers Candy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chocolate-covered   strawberry   <END> . I got 14  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  - I had to get an extra fig and goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  macaron and 2 extra Nutella  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> . I also got a  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_Dessert> fruit   pavlova   <END>  and a green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> . As for the  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's how each ranks:5/5:  <START:F_FI_Taste> fig & goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , Nutella, chocolate-covered strawberry4/5: Snickerdoodle, PB&J, Snickers candy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , maple- <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  bar3/5:  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  &  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END> , grandpa's  <START:F_FoodItem> blueberry pancake <END> , birthday cakeGreen  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> :I love green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and not a lot of places have green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> . The crust is crunchy. The  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  is deliciously creamy with a good green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . It's topped with a  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sesame nougatine <END>  and a  <START:F_FoodItem> raspberry <END> . Amazing! 5/5Fresh  <START:F_Dessert> fruit   pavlova   <END> :A  <START:F_Dessert> pavlova <END>  is a meringue topped with  <START:F_FoodItem> fruits <END> . It's  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END> . It's like a "healthier"  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  if you will. 5/5They warned me that the  <START:F_FoodItem> birthday cake <END>  was really sweet and that I shouldn't get it if I was torn between that and another  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . Hooray for honesty! The  <START:F_FI_Taste> fig & goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  macaron sounds a bit unusual but it's actually good since I love goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . Sweet fig + tart goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ...yum! Nutella is a no-brainer...it's instant love for me. The  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  &  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END>  sounded real good and looks so pretty and dainty but the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  were mild but really sweet. I think the  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  needs to be more pronounced. I got lucky to have the last maple- <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  macaron. Score! The  <START:Service> service <END>  is amazing  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Very friendly and honest. I was holding up the line with all the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  I got and I felt bad for the people behind me who came in just to pick up 2 items. But one of the girls who was helping me out offered them a cookie so everything was fine and dandy. Sure, the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  an average of $7 apiece and the  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  are $3.50-4.50 each - the  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  are HUUUUGE though (the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of your palm or about 4  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> ) and the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  are of  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . Hello? I don't mind  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for something good. You can actually get $1 off with a Yelp check-in. And if you buy more than 6  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> , you get 50cents off each additional you buy.I was smiling the whole time I was in the shop like a kid in candy store. My friend who was driving me around even said, "see! It's that smile that makes driving  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it".

So I had to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  cause I was starving and visiting my mother in the hospital. I gotta admit what I had was not  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  bad for a fast  <START:Food> food <END>  joint. I had their Spicy Chipotle  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> . It had some kick to it and the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  was enjoyable.

I've been coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for years just because I live across the street. The  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is horrible and the  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  are definitely high! I wish  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  closer cause I do like the  <START:Food> food <END> . My rating is based only on  <START:Service> service <END> .

Excellent hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END> . Had the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  and they were excellent.

Used to go to this subway all the time. But stopped going after I got extremely sick. They're  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  always gave off the vibe that they hate their job and this one  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  moves soo slow. Expect to wait a  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  hour if he's making your  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END> . And he also gave me a huge thick slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  (it was the end) and I was just disgusted so I decided to stop going their.

Good  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  when you're up to on the deck. Not sure about the inside as I didn't venture inside. Good  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  and an extensive  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Had the wasabi tuna  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , and what led me to order based on the description lacked in  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . The " <START:F_FoodItem> green wasabi <END> "  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  is very bland.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are s many other good things on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  that I will be sure to return...I'll just pass on the  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> .

At least it has  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . The $13  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  was about an inch below the rim of my  <START:F_Drinks> martini <END>  glass. I had to have that corrected immediately before the night started off wrong. The whole  <START:Food> dinner <END>  could be ruined but that  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  will not be. The  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  were orgasmic. Not happy that they charge $5 for a ramekin of horseradish cream  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Had a  <START:S_Gift> gift card <END>  that could take care of the whole  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and the idiot couldn't process it. He made it sound like it was my problem. It was issued by your  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , not sure why it was my issue. He actually asked it I wanted to use the  <START:S_Gift> gift card <END>  or  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  by other means. I just about lost it. I still have nightmares about the stupidity of that statement since  <START:S_Gift> gift cards <END>  are just as good as  <START:W_Price> cash <END> . If you work in the industry you'll get 25% off on Mondays after 9 p.m.

To begin, I am not the biggest fan of thai  <START:Food> food <END>  to begin with, but this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was great.  We went with another couple and seemed to order everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  I don't like  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> , but they got a  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  that was great, the  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  was excellent too.  I would make a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  if going for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  as it was super packed and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is relatively  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END> .

Its okay, I was not really sold on the whole idea that their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is similar to that of the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  from back east.  And I also don't know why they insist on giving  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END>  with every order.

After giving it another chance, my wife and I went back. Instead of  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  2 hours for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , we selectively chose to wait for a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Furniture> seat <END> . After 20 minutes we got one and this time the  <START:Food> food <END>  was great, not just good.

Nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with good  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> .   <START:Food> food <END>  is good and  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> .  If you enjoy  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> , this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go.  We had  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onion rings <END> , and of course some really good  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> .  I enjoyed everything about it.  I'll be back.

If you like  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> ...you'll like Seasons 52.   After my wife and I dined on the  <START:F_FoodItem> flatbread <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> trout <END> , we were convinced that in order to add  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  to their reduced calories, they poor on the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> .I read a few reviews  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  that mentioned bland  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  Possibly the management read the same reviews and asked their  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  to open the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  shakers?   It really spoiled what could have been a nice  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .And skip the  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> .   Very over  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  for what amounts to a plate of mixed greens and little else.  IMO, True Foods does a much better job.On the pro side, the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is very nicely designed with a pleasant  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and good  <START:A_Decor> lighting <END> .  And the wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and polite.

First time for me at DiVerti  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  & Grill. Clearly a great  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  being on the corner of University & Mill.  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  is in the back next to Jack In The Box. Pretty average  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  inside. Very typical of what you would find of a campus  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . Carpets been removed and they stained the exposed cement floor. 7+ HDTV's above the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  so good for catching a  <START:A_Entertainment> sporting <END>  event. We ordered Hot  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  to start and they were good. A few undersized  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  made it onto the plate, but no complaints. Entree:  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  w/  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  and cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  + jalapeno. It's a specialty  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  of theirs and it wasn't bad. Different, but good.  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were extremely reasonable and they had a deep  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  of items to choose from.  <START:Service> service <END>  was good. Granted  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were only about 10 people in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but Bartender was friendly and made some  <START:Service> recommendations <END> . Full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and lots of brews on tap. I'll be back to check out  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> !

excellent  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> , chat with a friend, or work.

I work downtown and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is awesome!  I've ordered both  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  - both fantastic.  They do all of their own  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  grinding and seasoning of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and it's  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  The  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  area is really tight and cramped but they just opened an upstairs too.  The  <START:Food> lunch <END>  time crowd is crazy busy, but overall excellent!  If you work downtown, definitely try it out (order take out).

The  <START:Food> food <END>  was surprisingly  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was impeccable.  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were a little high for what you get but all in all a great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  we will be back for sure.

We go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  about once a week for  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very friendly and efficient.  They take the time to get to know the customers and know when to look for a refill.  Good, not great, selection of tap  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  - all good and interesting but not extensive. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  is excellent - predominately gastro-pub.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> slider trio <END>  is great and the margherita  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is one of the best in town.  We also enjoy the  <START:F_FoodItem> carne asado & queso <END>  dip.

We were torn between Butters and Butterfields (based on yelp reviews). Very pleased with our choice to go to Butters Pancakes &  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> '! Everything looked so good that we ended up ordering 3  <START:Food> entrees <END> . The salmon/cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  scramble,  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  rojo and  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  French toast (AMAZING!!!). Everything was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and well  <START:W_Price> priced <END> . Also really enjoyed the  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> !

Outstanding  <START:Service> service <END> , very clean. Ordered the French Onion  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Eater (roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  on french with au jous)Both were  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  and hot. Will be going back :)

Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  bunch to get a good  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  are not bad either.

 <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_Ingredients> flavored <END>  well.   We had good  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>   <START:S_Staff> manager <END> .   <START:Food> food <END>  could have been warmer.

We were in Vegas a few days ago and wanted to try out Gordon Ramsay  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  so we called  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and found out they were booked until after 10pm.  No problem as she told us we could go to the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  if we wanted to as it has a full  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  We ended up going to  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at American  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and decided to have a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  at Ramsay.  When we got to the host stand we were told that the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was bought out for the night by a party.  This would have been great information to give us when we called earlier that day don't you think?! We were pissed but not as pissed as if we had decided to come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  We got over it and went to Max Brenner for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  which was great.  I don't know if this was the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing but it left a really bad  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in our mouths.  Maybe we'll try it the next time we go...but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are so many other  <START:Food> stellar <END>  choices in Vegas.

I'm a  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  snob......and I enjoyed this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was EXCELLENT!  Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Ryan, was knowledgable with a great sense of humor.  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  and big  <START:Food> portions <END> . They didn't skimp on the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  in our  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . Garlic edamame was very strong so make sure your date eats it too. We ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> albacore crunch roll <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> poke tuna <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  spicy tuna  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> lotus roll <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem>   shrimp   tempura roll <END> . Love the  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeño <END>  to top!  Everything was eaten with no complaints at all!

 <START:Service> service <END>  was a bit slow but the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  way more then made up for it.   <START:Food> dinner <END>  was okay. I'm sure I'll be back for football season.

I work downtown; been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  two or three  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  BBQ - Their's is good.  Good  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> , several  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  available, and the  <START:Food> portions <END>  (at least on the Plate) are fine (not heaping, but fine). I've had the Brunswick  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END> .  Okay, so simply based upon my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and input from friends, Brunswick  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  is usually thick and not soupy.  The  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  is soupy  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  - i.e. it has a lot of  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END> .  But, get this now... I've ordered it twice because it's good.  So it may not look like what you're expecting when you get it, but give it a try.Collard greens were good.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  seems to be a lot of  <START:F_Ingredients> stems <END> , but then, not everybody  makes the effort to pull some out.  Good  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> !All in all, this is a convenient spot for good BBQ in the center of downtown Charlotte.  Fortunately for us  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in the queen city, we now have two options available!!If you do go, get the deviled  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> .  They are good!One thing to note... if you order a soft  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , you're buying a bottle.  That's it.  So your refills are limited to your bottle.  Want more? Buy another.  I don't care for this approach.The wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very nice, friendly and informative.  Not terribly  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> , but then they don't have to do refills either. ;-)So, I like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and will most likely be back.

During the course of  exploring the Strip District of the city I was looking forward to having a pub-style  <START:Food> lunch <END>  somewhere in the area. Unfortunately, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I was hoping to visit was  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  on Sunday (should have checked the listing on yelp!). I walked into Kelly O's (which must be 180 degrees from a pub setting) to find a bustling  <START:Food> diner <END>  filled with guests of all ages and descriptions. My  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Andrea, approached the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  with 45 seconds and took my order. While tempted to have something from the Sunday extended  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , I opted for a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  Pot Pie  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and "Classic" patty melt. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  arrived quickly and hot (and I mean HOT!) and included a nice  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of crust and chunk of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was also good (hot), rye  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END> , good  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  melt and  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to the temperature.In spite of the business levels and somewhat cramped quarters  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no level of chaos at Kello O's. Instead,  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  moved about smoothly while  <START:S_Delivery> delivering <END>  orders and every departing guest was warmly thanked for their visit. The  <START:F_Drinks> patron <END>  mix ranged from children to folks well into their 80's. And,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was an obvious mix of " <START:F_FI_Size> regulars <END> " and first timers like me. Andrea was conversational, refilled my beverage without request and provided me with much appreciated information about the District. By the way, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,including  <START:A_Plc_RestRoom> restroom <END> , was remarkably clean which is saying plenty when considering the number of people that obviously went through the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . It's nice to visit a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that doesn't try to be "something they're not." The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is straightforward and genuine, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is "as promised," the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and connected with their customers.  I'll likely visit again with friends and family.

Tried it once w/ the kids, won't be back.Not bad, but for their high  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are better choices in LV.Noise level is high.

What I Learned From My Bacchanal  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>                                                               by Lori R    1)  If you want the SUPER Bacchanal  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  you must go after 3pm!  A lot of what I've heard described in reviews was NOT on the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  that we went to on a Tuesday at  <START:S_OpenHours> lunchtime <END> .    That being said, we also  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  of what others  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  at night.  We arrived around 10:45 a.m., so it was around $50 for both of us (before tip).   2)  TIP!  Add gratuity to that  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  when you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  it at the register.  They will MARK your receipt as a  <START:O_Payment> tipper <END> .  Don't know if that gives you extra credit or what, but they sure make note of it.  And if that's not reason enough, these  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  work hard keeping your  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  refilled and whisking away endless empty  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> .  They also take  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  and  <START:S_Cutlery> pepper shakers <END>  very seriously, as I heard a serious conversation that involved keeping track of whose were whose. (you have to ask for it, if you want them, by the way, they aren't on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ).  3) PACE YOURSELF.  They were changing over from  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  to  <START:Food> lunch <END>  when we arrived, so they kept putting out new things.  Favorites for me were some Asian items...the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggplant <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> green beans <END> ,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> .  Also thought the sliders were excellent  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onion rings <END>  very good.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was an awesome  <START:F_Ingredients> truffled <END>  potato gratin, a  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  tater tot casserole...a very flavorful  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  habanero  <START:F_Ingredients> sausage <END>  (although  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was nothing habanero hot about it).  From the Italian section, not a lot was calling out to me, but I did have a  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END>  which was good, although very big...a smaller one would have been even better.    Seafood was disappointing to me, as expectations were high based on the reviews I had read, but those were obviously for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  I asked if it was too early for  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs, and was told yes, not until after 3.  Steamed  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were good though.   4)  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  selection must be different this early in the day, also.  VERY GOOD though, but sadly, no macaroons!  I tried a  <START:F_Dessert> passion fruit meringue tart <END>  and a  <START:Food> chocolate creme brulee <END> .  Both were pretty good.   So, to sum up my personal Bacchanal  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , it was quite good, but being  <START:Food> lunch <END> -time  <START:Food> buffet <END>  eaters,  we have preferred our  <START:Food> lunch <END> -time experiences at both  Wynn and Wicked Spoon.

I was super excited to find a soul  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in Las Vegas, just moving  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  from Atlanta, and being a huge soul  <START:Food> food <END>  fan! I did my research on yelp and decided to give Soul  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  a try! We were greeted by a very nice  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  and  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  right away on a Sunday, so far so good! I ordered the Catfish  <START:Food> lunch <END> , comes with two sides and cornbread (cornbread is sooo yummy, prob the best part of the  <START:Food> meal <END> ) I really wanted Collard Greens, my fav, but they were out so I ordered Cabbage and yams. My husband ordered  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and gravy and Cabbage. We tried to order the ribs for our daughter off the kids  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , but they were out of ribs too :( So we ordered baked  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  for her.  After a pretty long wait we were told very apologetically that they were out of Cabbage also. At this point I did want to leave, or wish I would have known about them being out of  <START:Food> food <END>  so early on a Sunday, I would have liked the option to try again another day...BUT after  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  about 1.5 hrs we stayed, and  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  said that she would comp two sides for us. We finally got our  <START:Food> food <END> , honestly the  <START:Food> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  was quite laughable (maybe Ive been spoiled down south?) On the plus, the  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  but for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> / <START:Food> portion <END>  ratio and the wait I dont know  if I'll be going back? btw..we ordered the  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  Momma : Sweet  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> / Lemonade and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  Daddy : Kool Aid and Lemonade..Really Good, but VERY sweet... <START:F_Drinks> drank <END>  all my  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  for the month ;) lol

A bowl of potentialOn blistering cold nights, sometimes all it takes is a hot bowl of  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  to purge the chills & rejuvenate the senses. On a quiet little part of what appears to be dead-man's alley, sits this cozy little shoppe; a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  of hope in the sea of darkness.Upon entry a fog of authenticity & warmth envelopes you, as the hosts so graciously  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END> , get you situated & promptly serve you. Observant, keen & interested; a cohesive team that works together as they shuffle around caring for Tender, juicy, flavorful, the karaage hits every corner of your palate in a vibrant explosion of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  & feelings, as it slowly melts in your mouth. Generously portioned & accompanied with a side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Should  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  ever be shortage of  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  in the world, the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END>  would most definitely be my new vice. It oozes of authenticity, with an array of tantalizing  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> ; from the succulent  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , to the wafer  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  seaweed the fukumimi ramen is a testament to the establishment's commitment to excellence.Praises aside,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are definitely two major issues that almost made me drop a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> . Please do lay off the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> . I almost felt my tongue fall off after my 4th karaage. Also please cut back on the seaweed in the fukumimi ramen, that almost ruined the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  as I was winding down  <START:Food> dinner <END>  (it  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like seaweed  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  instead of ramen).Overall, I applaud the  <START:Service> service <END> , I shall plan a return in the near future.

Very good  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> . Have been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  always pretty good. Love the  baby bella mushroom  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  with sriracha  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END> . Sometimes  <START:Service> service <END>  slow but not a bad  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .

The  <START:Food> food <END>  is fabulous (I love the Gecko Burro and Pollo Fundido...and the  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  and cream--one word-- AMAZING), the  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  are awesome and their involvement in the community is so great! I love supporting a great business like this!

Came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> brunch <END> / <START:Food> lunch <END>  this Sunday; I wasn't overly hungry, but luckily everything was made a la carte, and  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  fairly! I shared the  <START:F_FoodItem> chorizo <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  balls with my friend (it came with 6 and a pile of shredded beets), the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was sweet and savory with leafy  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> cilantro <END> . I often find anything with  <START:F_FoodItem> chorizo <END>  to be too salty, but it was just right, especially with the sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  pairing. They have the healthy option to get  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  wraps instead of  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  or  <START:F_Ingredients> flour tortillas <END> , and seeing as  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was an abundant amount of free  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , I didn't miss having a tortilla-the  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  was perfect! The free  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  also came with three smaller and unique  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salsas <END> / <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  that varied in  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and spiciness-it was awesome to have variety. To top of the great  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> , the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was amazing. I loved the  <START:A_Decor> high ceilings <END>  and  <START:A_Decor> stained glass <END> , a  <START:A_Decor> huge rustic chandelier <END>  and beautiful well kept  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathrooms <END> . I will definitely be back!

Cute  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in an odd  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> . Very accommodating even though it was the last day for my Groupon. Very friendly and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> -especially the nice young man filling the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> !  I agree their  <START:F_Drinks> wines <END>  were not the highlight but they have other, name brand choices at reasonable  <START:W_Price> prices <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  was very good. Mixed bruschetta board looked odd because  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  didn't appear to be  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END>  but the varieties were good-very  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> generous <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END> . Had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:O_Experience> special <END> -carbonara. You could tell that was  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  and due to the richness, I thought the  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  was just right. Ate every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . Good find from Groupon!

Really good  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> , and the  <START:F_FoodItem> hamburgers <END>  are outstanding.  Prime Rib sliders were really good but could've used a little more jus for dipping.   Best for last:  The Cheddar Ale  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  is totally bonkers!  I've never had anything like it.   <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> , helpful with the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection, and pretty quick.   The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has a sports- <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  with a zillion TV's and a rambunctious crowd, but nothing I'd be afraid to bring the children to.

Excellent  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . Great  <START:W_Price> price <END> . Excellent  <START:Service> service <END> . Nice  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> . I  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>  Humari  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  if you are downtown! They literally pulled me in off the street and I have been going back ever since!

VEGETARIAN options in every  <START:Food> food <END>  category! Awesome  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END> - (3-6 am and pm) where else can you get a glass of Stella for $3!!?!? Football  <START:Offers> specials <END>  during every NFL  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> ! Phenomenal  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> - super nice and friendly! Open 24 hours! And  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  served 24/7! My new favorite hangout! Great gaming incentives!  You must go!!!

Dickey's saved my Thanksgiving!My brother & I decided to do Thanksgiving w/ friends super last minute. Hash House a Go Go ran out of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkeys <END> . WTF. So did Mimi's  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> , Lucilles, and Famous Daves. Double WTF. I needed Thanksgiving to-go and only 2 days to do it! Dickey's had 2  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  options for $49.99--Cajun  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  or Smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> . Of course, they were sold out of the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  but they had 1 smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  left. I called dibs!!!The pick-up process was easy. Zipped in and out within 5 minutes. They're  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  on Thanksgiving so pick-up needs to be the day before. They're open late so I picked up around 7pm. The  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  is wrapped in  <START:S_Delivery> foil <END>  and comes in an oven-safe aluminum pan ready-to-heat. It takes about 2 hours for the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  to reach eating temperature. Excellent  <START:S_Delivery> packaging <END>  since my friend just moved to Vegas and has minimal bake/cookware available. I needed low maintenance  <START:Food> food <END>  and Dickey's definitely made the holidays a bit easier for me. The  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  itself was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I was a little concerned that the smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  wouldn't have the Thanksgiving  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  I was looking for but it was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . Not the best I've ever had but very good. As much as I love cooking and being able to put all the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  I want into things. It was a relief to not have to deal with cooking a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  bird and focus on the epic  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>  of Settlers of Catan and Wii Tennis.

Just stopped in for my first Firehouse  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  and I wasn't disappointed. I had the  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  pastrami  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on white  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> , a little  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> , and very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . The pastrami itself was cut thick and also had a great  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . They have a hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  loaded with great, hard-to-find, hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> . The only complaint I have is that it does take a little while to get your  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , about 10-15 min. Now this certainly didn't ruin the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  for me and to be fair, they were getting slammed with orders. Overall, it is very easy to recommend this  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  shop. I'll certainly be coming back...next time for a Smokehouse  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  & Cheddar  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END> !

I don't usually write reviews but today I decided this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  one :)    I just got the 12  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  for the family and I have to say, it was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ! <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> , not greasy at all, coleslaw was awesome. Kids loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> biscuits <END>  ( I don't eat them ) but they said it was great. Also got an order of he butterfly  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  which was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  Definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  going back for!

 <START:Food> food <END>  is great! To be honest I first thought it had a fast  <START:Food> food <END>  concept and was a little sketchy but it's not at all. Not sure what I ordered, all I know is that it was one of  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  and it had  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  in it. Great new  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Definitely coming back!

 <START:Food> food <END>  is ok, had the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  taco, need a little more  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  . Can yall please add hooks under the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>  for us chicks please
