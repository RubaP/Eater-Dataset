The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I have ever asked my  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  to get me the  <START:S_Menu> recipe <END>  for a  <START:Food> dish <END> ! The Carolina coastal catch is hands down one of the best  <START:Food> dishes <END>  I've ever had. Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to celebrate our anniversary!
The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  helped me was very nice. However for $7 I expect  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  out of my  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , which wasn't  <START:Opinion> bad <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't great. Honestly I could get a better, less expensive  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  at  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  station two or Harris teeter.
I love  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> !  Huge  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  All very tempting, but from the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we visited we tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  Benedict and have been hooked ever since!!The Hollandaise  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is the best I've had ever - anywhere!  And the  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  come with  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  are to die for!!  I don't know how  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  do  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are thin, crisp, potatoey and very onioney.  I love  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> !!   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  only makes me sad  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I live in Durham and only get to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  about once a year.I did switch once and try the Dutch Baby, which was big and lovely and tasty with all the powdered  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> lemony <END> , but I really missed my  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  bennie and  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  and have never looked back.  Oh, you must try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and btw, get the  <START:F_FoodItem>   sour     cream   <END>  and applesauce for the tater  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> .
Ever just want excellent Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  for your party, just like Mama used to make but without the  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>  of preparation and cooking?  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  from Comedor's catering  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> :  green  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> flautas <END>  (substitution of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> ) and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  for our Halloween party.  Surprisingly, Comedor also included a quart  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem>   sour     cream   <END>  and two big bags of tortilla  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> .   <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  were extremely reasonable and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazing!  I'm not a big green  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  fan but I am now!  Chunks of fresh green  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  and boy, were the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  plump full of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> !  I've decided  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I'll never slave over a  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  stove to prep for a party or get together.  El Comedor's catering  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  saved me tons of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and headache AND  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was extremely affordable.  I got to enjoy our party and everyone couldn't say enough great  <START:Food> things <END>  about the  <START:Food> food <END> !
The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are good and the  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  are friendly.  I like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are open until 7pm, while most of the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> shops <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  much earlier.  The  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are kind of steep for what the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are so I marked a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  down. I had the d.a.m.  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and the  <START:F_Ingredients>     flavor <END> . <END>  <END>  are good.  The  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  fresh!  My husband had the bangers  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Price> 9 bucks <END> .  I like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have the  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END>  in individual baggies so the  <START:S_OpenHours> lunchtime <END>  crowd can just grab and go. Also,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  sell  <START:F_Appetizer> cookies <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:Service> treats <END> .  So  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's good.
I work in central Phoenix and have heard good  <START:Food> things <END>  about the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Finally got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with a friend and we both found the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  to have many  <START:Food> items <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we would love to try. I decided to have the  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END>  open faced and seared which is perfect.  Was seasoned deliciously and accompanied by a fresh side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  We had a friendly  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Meggie who was polite enough to write down the name of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  we  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> .  I will be back...soon.
I give Cooperstown a five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  - based on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END>  alone.  I ate  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with 2 kids and our  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  was $30 with tip.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is nothing fancy - just  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and refreshing on a hot day.  The girls said  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  fingers and mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was good and I really enjoyed the Ty Cobb  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  Also, love the giant glasses of iced  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was attentive and quick for being so busy.  Neat  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go overall.
Great  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  at a very reasonable  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> !
I used to be scared...I used to be petrified.  I was never one to branch out with my  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:Food> cuisine <END> , which meant  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I never had Indian  <START:Food> food <END>  before...until a couple of months ago when I was invited to a  <START:Food> dinner <END>  party. And at  <START:F_Ingredients>     flavor <END> . <END>  <END>  of India...my Indian  <START:Food> food <END>  cherry was broken.I decided to review  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  now...since I have experienced other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  since.  I tend to always come back to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> location <END> .  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  seems very clean, I love the Bollywood videos  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  play, and I love the  <START:Service> service <END> .  And I think  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have the best  <START:Food> buffet <END> !  Now, I am really  <START:Opinion> bad <END>  at names of the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  (which is why I end up at the  <START:Food> buffet <END> ...I may not know the names, but I know what I like looks like)See me  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  at  <START:Food> lunch <END>  real soon :)
I have eaten  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several times only because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  right around the corner from my house. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was good the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we ate  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and has been down hill ever since.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like the prepackaged  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  you find at the store and the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are so small. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a philly  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  and a california  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  and all you can  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  was the  <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END> . Totally disappointed.
mmmm New Mexico style mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  in Arizona! We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a number of  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  and shared to  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  a combo of  <START:Food> things <END> :  The Chile con (green) Carne & The Chile Relleno were my favorite!  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  and Chimichanga were just good. Our favorite was the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_Dessert> sopapillas <END>  (w red  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ) and shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> gorditas <END> . You can't find authentic  <START:F_FoodItem> gorditas <END>  anywhere but Texas and NM, so what a  <START:Service> treat <END> ! Si Senor is very generous in  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  complimentary  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  w 4 different  <START:F_FoodItem> salsas <END>  when you arrive then  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_Dessert> sopapillas <END>  for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . ( <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  might charge for a 2nd  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  though -not sure, never had to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  -ask your  <START:S_Staff> server <END> ). Only negative I can express would be  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't have the soap filled in the men's  <START:A_Plc_RestRoom> restroom <END>  (per my husband ;)
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  little hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  packs some big  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . We came to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  family-owned  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  to celebrate our friends' engagement.   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are regulars and said we'd love the  <START:Food> food <END> ;  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were right.  We were greeted warmly and informed  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  would take a bit  <START:S_Del_Time> longer <END>  due to a large catering  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  was also cooking.  No matter since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't seem like much of a delay at all.  We enjoyed  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ,  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , and conversation before our  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> courses <END>   <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END> .  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> marsala <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a generous helping of three pieces of moist  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  with a very tasty  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and lots of  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> ; I highly recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> dish <END> !  Believe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  or not, I didn't have any  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> , but my friend's  <START:F_FoodItem> spaghetti <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  looked  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  I love little hole-in-the- <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  places like  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  over a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  any day. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is friendly and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is good.PS-our friends are having Buon Gusto cater  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  wedding reception, which means I get  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> marsala <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END> --grazie!
Thank god for newer reviews... I should have listened to  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> !!!Been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a few times before back in like 2003-2004  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  frame. Remember the  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  to be much better back then. Was in town visiting and wanted to return to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  again. Yes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the same old  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty crappy.  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  HORRIBLE and these  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  working  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  lack major personality.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was constant confusion as to if we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  or not, what we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> , and so forth. The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was actually a bit rude I thought constantly rushing us and reaching across me constantly to take  <START:S_Cutlery> silverware <END>  and  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  from other side of the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , and at 2  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  intervals???Will not return. Seriously if you are pissed to do  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  type of work then get a new job. If you run a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  you better be a little personable.
I haven't lived in Pittsburgh for 4 years, and even now after all  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , on a Thursday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  I wish I was still lived in Oakland so a few friends and I could hit up Fuel for some  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . Fuel is the best  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in Oakland at  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> , particularly if your over 21.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a little  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END>  but the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  (100 different  <START:S_Menu> varieties <END> ) is the best virtually anywhere. The  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  starts at 11, so you can go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  get  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  with some friends and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a good  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  is always excellent, and after 11 a good value. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is always good. I love the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but I could see how  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  could find  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  irritating.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's loud (particularly when  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> ) and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END> . However in my four years going to fuel  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  never once dissuaded me, because the  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is just too good and trying the new  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  is just too much fun.
Ahhhh the Melting Pot. Where do I begin... <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is a little slice of heaven. The Melting Pot is great for a girls get together and  <START:Food> anything <END>  in between. The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:Food> fondues <END>  are my favorite.
I'm always on the lookout for your basic  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and 2/3  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  so when I saw La'Wan's in a strip shopping center on South Tryon, I thought I'd give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a try. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was immediate and attentive.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  and a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  from which to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . I chose the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  because I wanted some  <START:F_Ingredients> vegetables <END> . Although the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  fine, the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is very limited in  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> :  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END> , fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and a couple of other  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  would have been OK except  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  charged over $9.00 for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . If I go back, I should probably choose from the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .
My girlfriend's family was visiting from Milwaukee.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  wanted to go out for a nice  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  would be suitable for Grandpa and a celiac diet.  We decided on the Stable Grill.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the perfect choice.Before  <START:Food> dinner <END>  we all had a few of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  famous old fashioneds.  Korbel is  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  rail  <START:F_Drinks> brandy <END>  so you know  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are going to be good.   <START:S_Staff> her <END>  dad loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had a  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  raved about.  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  which were solid.   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  came with these  <START:F_Ingredients> buttered <END>  red  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  were simple but  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  My GF had the  <START:F_FoodItem> perch <END>  which  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  thought were some of the best  <START:S_Staff> she <END> 's had.The Stable's  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is quite remarkable.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is basically an old stable fitted with a full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and  <START:A_Plc_Bar> dining   room   <END> .  Old wood  <START:A_Places> floor <END> , rock  <START:A_Decor> walls <END> , a huge barn  <START:A_Fur_Door> door <END>  and rickety stairs leading to a second  <START:A_Places> floor <END> . A lot of trendy places aim for the kind of  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  the stable offers but you cant duplicate authenticity.All in all  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a supper club style dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  in a cool old  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  setting.  If you are looking to try something off the beaten path and are tired of  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , trendy  <START:Food> aiolis <END> , beet  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  or whatever the latest foodie  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> is  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  week, the Stable Grill at Quiveys Grove is just right.
Sows of all ethnicities are  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  at China One!China One is a  <START:F_FI_Size> massive <END>  Mongolian-Chinese  <START:Food> buffet <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is never too full, in a great  <START:Restaurant> location <END> , features reasonable  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  and most of the offerings tempt repeatedly.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are a couple of issues, though. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is pedestrian and too carefree; the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  are space cadets and rarely present timely.  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  plenty of fluids ... then  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  ... the  <START:Food> food <END>  is liberally laced of  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  MSG. As expected, the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is old and a  <START:F_FI_Healthy> health <END>  risk with  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  swallow greatly increases.The review reads a little negative, but China One is a sensational guilty pleasure for its  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> . If you see me at the  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> , though ... step aside and give respects.
I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  about 5 times total, and I am completely unimpressed. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is overpriced and just not  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I have no problem  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for a good  <START:Food> meal <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  wasn't a good  <START:Food> meal <END> . I could have made what ended up on my  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  from the contents of my refrigerator and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would have  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  better. The one caveat to my "My Florist has crappy  <START:Food> food <END> " attitude is the  <START:F_Ingredients> cinnamon <END>  scones. These are absolute heaven. Too  <START:Opinion> bad <END>  I won't be back for  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> , as getting one means dealing with the rude  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . Out of the five visits, only once was the  <START:Service> service <END>  decent, and I think  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was only because my dining companion knew the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's  <START:Opinion> bad <END> . I never went in dressed like a bum or  <START:Service> treated <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  obnoxiously, but yet the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  had no problem  <START:Service> treating <END>  me like a second class citizen who didn't belong in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . I don't know what kind of qualifications you have to have to get decent  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> , but I obviously don't have  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> . I won't be back ever.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a shame, too, because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is within walking distance.
Va Dang is pretty darn  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . I prefer Pho Thanh, but thats my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . I like the  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END>  better at Pho Thanh, however Va Dang has way better  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END>  available.
Funky strip mall like  <START:Restaurant> location <END>  but great  <START:Food> food <END> . Got some free  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , I was stoked. Great  <START:F_Appetizer> tapas <END>  to share, good for light eaters or to hold over a drunken hunger with out making you sick. Just say no to a  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  will not be pretty, stick with FireFly for great  <START:F_Appetizer> tapas <END> !
Best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in the valley!  Not only is  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  in my  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END> ; which makes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  great,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have some of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  around. Never too long of a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  and always  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Service> service <END> . Competitive  <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END>  and large  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . Its nice to go back and get the same  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  each  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
We've been dying to visit  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for years! Why did we  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for so long??? On countless occasions, we've heard nightmare stories of  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  for three  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  or  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .   <START:S_Staff> people <END>  seem to rave about the authentic and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Food> italian <END>  style  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . We had to have a two  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  break on a weekday.  We took a gamble to see if we would be able to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  within a reasonable amount of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and finally check  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  off our list. To our surprise we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  within 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  and had our  <START:Food> food <END>  brought out within 15-20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> . We had the ' <START:F_FoodItem> caprese <END> '  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and the biancoverde  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END>  added and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was INCREDIBLE!!! The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was fresh and tasty and  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  reminded us of great  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in Italy! BEST  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in the Phoenix metropolitan area! Note  <START:Worthiness> worthy <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , but probably would not  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  3+  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a wonderful  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> --if you have a  <START:S_Del_Time> longer <END>  break!Note: The website states, " <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  accepted for parties of 6-10 when possible."
I don't go in enough for the morning  <START:S_Staff> barista <END>  to know my name, but  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  always phrases  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  as, "I'm sorry, I should know  <START:Restaurant> this <END> , what is your name again?" and I find  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> charming <END> .  The homemade whipped  <START:Food> cream <END>  is almost impossible to resist - and if you're going to do  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  then you might as well have  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  be resting upon a large Velvet Mocha - one of the best  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  in Phoenix.  I feel like I should bring my Powerbook  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  - and I even find myself counting how many non-mac users dare to crack open  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  cases.  Still,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a fun little  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  with friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  and fabulous hot  <START:F_Drinks> beverages <END> . Bring an out of town SF or NY hipster who refuses to believe  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is ANY culture in Phoenix.
Since we didn't hit Craftsteak on our last trip to Vegas, I made a point to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . No  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  my husband and I have lost 120lbs together and are just eating differently. So, we were a tad  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  conservative, but still splurged and left with our bellies full. We split the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bisque <END>  to start, which was good, but cannot compare to Kokomo's (which is now  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  to make  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for Tom's Heritage  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  BOO). I didn't like the large pieces of  <START:Food> tarragon <END>  on top, which feels like chewing on pieces of grass, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was tolerable. The  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  was nice and tender.For  <START:Food> dinner <END>  we split the  <START:F_FoodItem> 10oz   filet   <END> , the  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> puree <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END> .   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was still so much  <START:Food> food <END> ! The  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>  was made with  <START:F_Ingredients> butternut <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> squash <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END>  and was so rich and creamy and really wonderful. I know  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is what properly made  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like and how easy  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  can be to get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wrong.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> puree <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> filet <END>  were absolute heaven.For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> pumpkin <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  and I was pretty disappointed.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a small circle of mushy  <START:F_Ingredients> pumpkin <END>  with a vanilla  <START:Food> cream <END>  of some kind on top of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I hate to say  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , but  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  Factory  <START:F_Dessert> cheescake <END>  was better than  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  stuff. Major bummer, thus the deletion of a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> . When you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  $15 for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  at a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> this <END> , you want to shove your face  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  in and eat 15 of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> , not just pick at  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and wish  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  like at a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>  where you hate  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .
Mediocre at best.. went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was in NY/NY and we were staying  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  Hungry and in the mood for  <START:Food> italian <END>  we went in...  <START:Service> service <END>  was good, the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was awesome.. <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  dry, and without much  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> ...  The  <START:F_FoodItem> swordfish <END>  was pretty good but again not much  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .. keep in mind we had just  <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  in Vegas and were hungry and tired and excited and didn't have any  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  in our system... to me  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I would eat and enjoy just about  <START:Food> anything <END> !!...  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was still mediocre at best..  Wouldn't recommend  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and definitely not going to eat  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again.
Nice  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  good  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  even have a little  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  i also like  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  too all around a good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat!
Always  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and great  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ! We enjoyed another wonderful  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  just last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was sooo  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to getting 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . However, one thing changed my mind. I had a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  in the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END> , and I was on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and on my  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  notes, I proposed a  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't ready when I got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  so we had to take a timer and stand around.30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later we got the  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was facing  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  which was a good  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the only reason  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't get 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . The  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  took way to long to get and even when I put  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  for in advance.The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was nice and quick, and explained the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  just right. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazing! I love  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and decided to go with  <START:F_FoodItem> lasagna <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was hot and fresh  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't a loud  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and was very clean. I wil love to come back to try something else on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .
 <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's taken me forever to get to Chelsea's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> , a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I've been wanting to try for years! I went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  past weekend and was so happy to finally head to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  beautiful  <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  has a breezy island vibe with sprawling  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patios <END>  both at the front of the house and back. <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's no wonder the spot was bustling when I went for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at 9 p.m. on a Friday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  -- the mixed crowd of all ages packed the house, which had cozy  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  and striking printed  <START:A_Decor> curtains <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  make guests feel right at home, no matter the crowd. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  contained a few  <START:A_Ent_Tv> televisions <END>  with  <START:A_Entertainment> sporting <END>  events on, so you could  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  in any type of  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  you wanted -- cozy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> dining   room   <END> , spacious  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  or at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .Our  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were professional and attentive, and the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was fantastic and hugely portioned -- I took  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>  of mine home. I loved the Lucy's "Spiked"  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END>  ($8)  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  I got, with  <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END>  and fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> rosemary <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was refreshing and strong and didn't have a gross  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  --  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was easy to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and tasty.We started with the  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  ($10), which is pretty much a must-try since all the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> , including the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , are all made in-house. The  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  had the perfect amount of spiciness (maybe a 7 out of 10), and the  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  would have been great to eat on its own.For my  <START:Food> meal <END> , I tried the Shangri-La Vegetarian  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  ($12), which consisted of  <START:F_Ingredients> grains <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> nuts <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> seeds <END> . I usually don't get French  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , but I did  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had really great seasoning and the perfect amount of  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was tasty, but the consistency made  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  difficult to hold together. Not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  matters --  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a great  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was really filling.Chelsea's biggest impression on me was the  <START:Service> service <END>  of the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , who made you feel  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  and valued from start to finish.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's no wonder  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  remain so loyal to the  <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>  --  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seems like a wonderful  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for anyone to have a great  <START:Food> meal <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  review is just specific to  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Service> service <END> . I took my mom to  <START:Food> lunch <END>  after a busy morning of shopping at the mall. We were greeted right away and asked which we would prefer, a  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  or a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . I love when  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  give you a choice if either are available. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was very  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END> , friendly and knowledgeable about the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Mom and I both had  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  Cob was so yummy! I almost ate  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  all and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a good  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END> ! The only downside to the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  charged me 3.25 for an unsweetened  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> . What??! I should have  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:S_Staff> their <END>  house  <START:F_Ingredients> chardonnay <END>  for a few bucks  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END> .. Oh well.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  else was wonderful and I'll certainly return for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  again soon.
So I have been a customer at Ticoz from literally day one.  I have been through the change in ownership and I have to say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the current  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> , Joe, is so terrific!   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  comes over and chats with us and is always so awesome and down to earth!  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is even better lately (if  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's possible) and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  always go the extra mile to make your dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  terrific.    I'm not someone who has been to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  one  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and is reviewing  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ......I am not a  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  spokesperson!  Just a very satisfied customer.
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a hidden gem in Las Vegas. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is right in the middle of the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>  at Palace Station. I was expecting an actual  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , not a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  with 20  <START:A_Furniture> chairs <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a long  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to sit down so I figured  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was definitely  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> . Luckily, I was with other  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  so I played Roulette while we  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> . Once  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  take your  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  very calmly.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  do not rush you considering  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  of  <START:S_Staff> people <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  to eat. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  in steam pots instead of a gas burner.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> oyster bloody mary shooters <END>  and the Pan roast at level 7 hot..  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is soo good I would recommend  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to anyone...
Margherita Doc  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , some of the best I've had, and we had GREAT  <START:Service> service <END> !!! Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  Natalia was fantastic and very informative...great first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  :)
You get a lot of  <START:Food> food <END> . But  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is poor and  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are high.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is overrated and  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  too high!!!
My favorite Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in town. I think Taqueria Guadalajara has better  <START:Food> food <END>  in general, but I prefer El Pastor. The  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  are just as good and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is easier to get to and always easy to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END> ; and the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  are fantastic! The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very welcoming, making  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  easy to come back regularly.If you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  one of the  <START:Food> meals <END> , get an extra  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  a la carte.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are too good to come in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and not have at least one.
Very Disappointing is an understatement! Good China boasts on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  website  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were the 2007 recipients of New York's Top 100 Chinese/Asian Fusion Award, and all I can say is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  may have been so in 2007. However, Good China fails to live up to  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  reputation, today, 7-years later. My family has recently moved back to the United States from living in Singapore for the last 4-years, and we are originally from New York. So, we have a little knowledge in authentic Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  and Americanized New York Chinese  <START:Food> food <END> --and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  eating  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  really fell short.Starting with the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , we had "Spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> ", and for those of you New Yorkers, most  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  have flavorful " <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> "  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  are stuffed with a combination of  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts, and Asian  <START:F_Ingredients>     flavor <END> . <END>  <END> . What we received were  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  saturated "Spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> ". Because  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were so oily, each  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  oozed  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> , canceling out any  <START:F_Ingredients>     flavor <END> . <END>  <END>  from the  <START:F_Ingredients> vegetables <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> spices <END>  used. We could have literally squeezed out enough  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  to reuse. We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the " <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  Puffs", which many Chinese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , including many in Singapore call " <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  Rangoon"--a type of dim sum.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was very little filling used inside the wrappers, and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seemed  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  someone might have been heavy handed with  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> , because  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were incredibly  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  instead of savory. You could not even  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  any  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  (and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  may have used imitation  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  from the looks of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ), nor could you  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  the  <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had been turned into a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:Food> cream <END>  due to the over use of something  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  as a flavoring.What can I say about the "War Wonton  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> "? The proper name for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  is "Wor Wonton  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ", but what we had was "Slime  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ". The wontons had been so over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  melted off the filling, producing an off-putting slimy  <START:Food> texture <END> . However, the  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END>  was okay--a bit on the salty side.Next, the  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  we tried. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  "House Lo Mein". Obviously,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  use Fettuccini  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  instead of authentic Chinese  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  too was on the salty side and the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> --not at all tender. We also had " <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  Foo Young" ( <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  Foo Yong), which were flat and  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> -like in  <START:Food> texture <END> --nothing like  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  Foo Young.  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  Foo Young is, simply put, an  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END> . Well,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is in Chinese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in New York and Singapore. How can you mess up an  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END> ? Oh, you can make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  the consistency of  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> ! The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  use on top of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seems to be the same brown salty  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  used on other  <START:Food> dishes <END>  we had like the " <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ". " <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ", in  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  we have ever eaten  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , is usually a light garlicky  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> --not a brown salty  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  with no hint of  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .The "Sesame  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ", we are still not sure if  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was actually  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  inside the heavily  <START:F_Ingredients> battered <END>  nuggets--the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was hard and over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  also  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like someone had poured a whole bottle of honey over the nuggets--no sesame  <START:F_Ingredients> seeds <END>  in sight. In addition, if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  could not get worse, when you looked in the container of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  supposed "Sesame  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ",  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seems  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  spooned in all the burnt residual  <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  sits within the  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  used for frying--meaning  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are not periodically cleaning and changing the  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  between  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> --gross!On the plus side, the "House Fried  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> " was descent,  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  was good, and the  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  looked clean. Overall, even though the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are average, you are overpaying for poor  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .
A few years ago, I would have given  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> location <END>  a 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  review but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has gone downhill since then.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  used to give  <START:Offers> discounts <END>  if you only got a few  <START:Food> things <END>  in your  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have continually raised  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  while giving  <START:A_Env_Size> smaller <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END> . I'm pretty sure  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  use  <START:A_Env_Size> smaller <END>  spoons. And I get  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are a corporation and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the decisions aren't always up to  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no denying the value has gone down hill.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's still good  <START:Food> food <END> , but not  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> 9  dollars <END>  a person.
Very nice! Cugino's is one of the few true  <START:Food> italian <END>  delis in town, and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have a good assortment of what  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  from back East are used finding.Yes,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are plenty of popular favorites  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we all know:  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> subs <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> parmigiana <END> , etc., and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are also some  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> foods <END>  you might not be familiar with.I have an "old world"  <START:Food> italian <END>  heritage thanks to my mom.  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  St. Joseph's day,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  made  <START:F_FoodItem> arancini <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  Easter  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  made a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzagiana <END> . When I first found Cugino's I was floored!  <START:F_FoodItem> arancini <END>  readily available! Mortadella in the deli case! Checkerboard  <START:F_Appetizer> cookies <END>  by the dozen! Frozen  <START:F_FoodItem> sfogliatelli <END>  to take home and bake!If you've been looking for  <START:Food> food <END>  like Nonna used to make, or you're feeling a little adventurous, or you just want some good  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  by the slice, head to the University district and give Cugino's a try.
CHECK YOUR  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  BEFORE LEAVING!!! I'm not one to complain or even care much when my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  is messed up; as I work in the  <START:Food> food <END>  industry, and understand  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  shot happens.. But  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's happened  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  than 3 times now, at around 12 am- (not a busy  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ) Just make sure you get what your  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not fun to get home and not have someone's  <START:Food> meal <END> .
A  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  has to earn my respect. First pass is a quick look-through of the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  in the display. I try to be unobtrusive about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  so I don't look like a tourist, but if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's stacked up and already cut, or if I see a big vat-o'-spicy- <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> -with-mayo, or a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> microwave <END>  on the back counter, I'll just flee, or I'll  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  California  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> .Second pass is to throw down the gauntlet to the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END> . A triple-whammy  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> , fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  and yellowtail  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END> . Typically  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  will  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  between $30 and $40, so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had better be the goddam best the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  has to offer. Kojisan did not dissapoint. Either later in my first visit or on my second when we had dropped the pretense,  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  stuck out his chest and beat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with a quick head nod to say  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  took pride in vanquishing my challenge with ease.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was at least as good as the finest  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  I've ever had in the valley (cut and  <START:Service> served <END>  by  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  on Shea's KING of the Valley, "Fred"-san).Now, I have spent the last 10 years at Ayako, and over those years, I developed a scale of  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is " <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  eating". At the lowest level  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is "good", then "very good", then "excellent". And at the very top is "life changing". Ayako was always very good, usually excellent, and sometimes if you're lucky, life changing. Hana is always excellent and very often is life changing.Now I realize  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  seems to be a lot of hoopla about a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , right? I mean, come on. But if you're a serious sushicon (connoisseur), you know what I'm talking about. Yeah, I know some supersnob sushicons won't look at  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  unless if's alive just before you eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Yeah,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's pretty much a life-changing  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , but hey,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is PHOENIX, for god's sake.The third pass is the whole, deep-fried  <START:F_FoodItem> ama-ebi <END>  ( <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ).  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a test of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END> , knowledge of just the right  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , how to prepare  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  (which pieces of the shell to remove), and of the simplicity in preparation. The resulting presentation can seem scary to the unwashed. Two big eyes are staring up at you, tentacles sticking  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  which way, now crispy and yummy, and my final squeeze of  <START:F_Ingredients> lemon <END>  completes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The "brains" are the best part.The fourth pass is if  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  know how to make a proper  <START:F_FoodItem> tamago <END>  (cold  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> , crepe-like thing).  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's fluffy like  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has seemingly thousands of layers upon layers, folded over and over like the finest katana. Once again, Kojisan presented some of the finest  <START:F_FoodItem> tamago <END>  I have ever  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> .The fifth and final pass is the hardest to fulfill. Natto is fermented soybean, which when potent smells like the nastiest stinky socks you've ever experienced. Most American  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  bars won't  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just too offensive to nearby  <START:Food> diners <END> . Those  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  do  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  a toned-down mild version  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is like a strong  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . Natto is best  <START:Service> served <END>  stirred with soy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and topped with the  <START:F_FoodItem> yolks <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> quail <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> , sprinkled with finely cut dried  <START:F_Ingredients> seaweed <END> . As you are ready to eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , dump  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  over a piping hot bowl of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and devour. Wanna guess if Hana serves  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ?The  <START:Service> service <END>  at Hana is edgy.  <START:Service> service <END>  uniform is hip, and like most  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  bars, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  freely yell at one another across the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> dining   room   <END> . Although Kojisan keeps the A/C on in winter to flush out loiterers, and even though multiple busers swoop down after your last  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to clear your empty  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> , you'll have to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  45 to 70  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  at prime- <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  on prime  <START:S_OpenHours> nights <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  can be awkward in the small corner of the front part of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  without glaring at other  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  customers, willing  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  to get the heck out of your  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  so you can sit down. Arrive before 6:40 or after 9:10 if you loathe the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .Please don't try  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . And please don't tell other  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's just not enough  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for us all.  LOL. Enjoy.
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a favorite of mine in Oakland. Great  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> seaweed <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> !  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of other  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  as well but I usually go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . If you work or go to school in Oakland,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a nice little  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to grab  <START:Food> lunch <END> . But  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is one caveat - if you arrive during the  <START:Food> lunch <END>  rush, you may have trouble finding a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  and the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  may be a bit long.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  can be problematic if you need to get back to work in a timely fashion. Otherwise  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a favorite of mine. Ah, my eel  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  has just  <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  and my spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  is on the way.  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to enjoy! I encourage you to do the same.
Requested the Mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  vegetarian and got a  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> .  Then not checked on for 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  and then had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for a new  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  F  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  If given the choice of any other  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  You should choose another  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  almost an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  for some  <START:F_FoodItem> macaroni <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  I could have drove home and made some kraft in a box for how long  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  isht took.
When I first moved to Arizona, I wanted to try new establishments I couldn't find back east. My friend who lives in South Scottsdale brought me  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , and I'm  <START:Food> italian <END> , so I was excited. For being named " <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> " its  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  wasn't too great. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> caesar <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> spaghetti <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was OK but nothing to rave about. I wouldn't recommend  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , and I havent been back, but for  <START:Food> italian <END>  and good  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> , I would prob go somewhere else.
The  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  was good and the  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  large. Went with Number 92. Beautiful  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  and interesting Buddhist icons give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a touch of the exotic.   <START:Service> service <END>  a bit slow and  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  never smiled, but acceptable.  Lots of other options in the area - would try something else next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
We stopped by the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  at Treasure for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  before going to the Cirque de Soleil  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> . I'd never been to a  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  before so I didn't really know what to expect  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> -wise. I walked around & first got a  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  "American BBQ"  <START:Food> items <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  seemed very  <START:F_FI_Taste> bland <END>  so I decided to try again. Meh, not much better the second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  with the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  & other small  <START:Food> items <END> .I saw a lot of  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  at the  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  so I figured I'd give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a shot.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , I was satisfied. I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ravioli <END>  tossed with  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  in an alfredo /  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> -based  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . I wish I wouldn't found  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  first because I probably would've just gotten two helpings of  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> ! The  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were also pretty good.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a large  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  and I tried out a few different  <START:Food> things <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I enjoyed. One of the highlights was the  <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END> .Would we stop again? With as much as Las Vegas has to offer, probably not, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's definitely a convenient/decent option if you're at the  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  anyways.
I have been coming to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> location <END>  for at least 6 years.  The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END>  has gone down quite a lot  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  past year.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  used to be our family's favorite  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  and have prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END> .  We brought some friends over for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  last month and was very disappointed.  Also,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cook <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  as we wanted.  When we complained  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  only offered to put  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  back on the grill. No apologies.   <START:Service> service <END>  was mediocre and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the meet is not as good as  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  used to be.  I am sad as i had hoped  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> things <END>  would be as  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  used to be... A  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  dining  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  I won't be back.
HORRIBLE! Awful  <START:Service> service <END> , burned  <START:Food> food <END> , dirty  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END> , ants on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> , limited  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> , the list could go on and on. The " <START:Food> meal <END>  Deal" includes  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  which is a can of Safeway brand  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> . STAY AWAY! I will never go back to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . If you want to overpay for  <START:Food> food <END>  from a what looks like a dirty crack house,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is your  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !
Mac n  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  Squared!   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's all I have to say.Everyone else was trying to be  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>  by eating a  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  or  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , but c'mon when in a new  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you have to try the signature  <START:Food> dishes <END> .The Mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  Squared didn't look even  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to what you might get out of a Kraft box.  Instead  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a white gooey  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  (not elbows) with  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , bacon (big pieces), and a  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  (?).  Absolutely  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .But  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , one of the most important  <START:Food> things <END> ....the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> .  You walk in and to your left is an enclosed  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  full of kegs.  You can see in via the glass and  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  the lines running from the kegs up to the ceiling.  Then you see huge chrome pipes running across the ceiling through the foyer into the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and across to the center  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  To add perspective we are taking about a hundred  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> .Dafe
I honestly think  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's cheap, convenient and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great (obviously, you wanna to go right when  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  open since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's fresh) i think for the theme and  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's totally  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , plus for  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in arizona is not  <START:Opinion> bad <END> ! the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly. I would rather eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  100000000000  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  than RA or Stingray  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> 
We've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a few  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  times and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  do  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  attention to the  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  levels when we discuss with the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  taker. If you make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  set the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  up and take you in right away. Much better to eat  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  way. Although we have  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  mild spiciness levels the last few times, I think I am going to give  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  a shot again next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  spiciness level. I think  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  probably  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  best with spiciness at the  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  level. I like  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> curries <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> vegetables <END>  better than the tandoori  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> .
I have been to BLT  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  multiple times and  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is amazing! the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  are great and  <START:Service> served <END>  anyway you want  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  i am a med rare man and the last few times i have been  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has been 100% on! the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and able to  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  you super quick. the quotes on the backs of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  shirts are not only funny but keep you entertained when you  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  on your  <START:Food> meal <END>  to come. and the  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  are the best around having the choice between spiked and not spiked  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  is nice  <START:Service> treat <END> . (try the Twinkie  <START:F_Drinks> shake <END> ) the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  is open so you see the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>  and the grill so you know your  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  in a clean  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> . all in all the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  is nice and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are open LATE like a great Vegas strip  <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>  should be!!!! thank you BLT and see you next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  i am in Vegas
The house  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  alone are  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  a visit.  My favorite  <START:Food> items <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  are the  <START:F_FoodItem> burrata <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> , the fresca  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with gorgonzola honey dressing, the Sorrento  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and pink alfredo  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , and the Amatriciana  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  (just a touch spicy).  Great date- <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>   <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  inside, and the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  area offers a casual option too.
I stopped in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on impulse en route to Hobby Lobby and upon seeing  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was 5:30 I realized I was in  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  for the early bird  <START:Offers> specials <END>  for $8.99.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the six-oz Sirloin with two sides.   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I was aware in advance  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  when  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  ask you if you want  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> costs <END>  extra even though  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  don't tell you about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .The green  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  were probably saltier than is  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  in the "mushy" style, which I like fine, and had lots of good bacon pieces and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> caesar <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  couldn't have been much better, cold, crisp and crunchy with just the right amount of good dressing. The  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  but awfully  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  to blend with the  <START:Food> meal <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  like a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  unto themselves, especially with the  <START:F_Ingredients> cinnamon <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> .  I was impressed with the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  which was so thick  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was almost an ovoid.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  rare than  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  rare but I like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  fine, too.  The impressive part was how nicely the  <START:S_Cutlery> knife <END>  cut through  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and how easy  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was to chew.  I've gotten  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  twice in the last few months from Outback for a couple dollars  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  were so tough you couldn't stab  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with a fork, had to be a lumberjack to saw through  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  chewed like your grandmother's old shoe leather.    <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a real  <START:Service> treat <END>  to eat  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  one and have  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  be the way a good  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  should be.  I would come back easily, and hope I will sometime.  My only objection is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  constantly try to upsell you to  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> , etc.  The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was very nice and efficient, I just don't want the times I have to say No, thank you to outnumber the times I say Yes, please.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  sets a tone of negativity in its own way.
A nice and affordable spot for a filling  <START:Food> breakfast <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> , toast,  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> homefries <END> , and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  for under $10. My  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  almost immediately and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . My  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was also very  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  and attentive. I will definitely make  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  a regular spot of mine.
First, I must disclose  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  being married to a Peruvian who is most demanding about about  <START:Food> anything <END>  culinary and, particularly Peruvian  <START:Food> cuisine <END> , I have come to be somewhat  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  demanding myself.  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  being said, I would recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  even though I gave  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  only three  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . We sampled the chicha morada, a non-alcoholic  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  made from purple  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  with some  <START:F_Ingredients> citrus <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cinnamon <END>  added, and were comforted to find  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fresh made (as opposed to mixed from powder).The papa a la huancaína ( <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  in a Huancayo style), a Peruvian staple presented in regional variations, was a good  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , its fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  noticeably tasty. For my own personal  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  I would have preferred a touch of spiciness, but hey,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  would not be a valid reason to down  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .The  <START:F_FoodItem> papa rellena <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  with a  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  filling) did not fare as well, the filling  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  a little on the greasy side.The seco de cordero, a sort of  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , came in a very generous  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  and did not disappoint. Again, the fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  carried the day!Unfortunately, we were to full to  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> , a project for another day.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was very good, even my picky spouse agreed  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:Worthiness> worthy <END>  of a return visit.
I have lived in the area for years and always passed  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  wondering what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was.  Finally, my Husband and I decided to give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a try...we had no idea what to expect.  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is very intimate.  Some of the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  are long with benched  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  so yes  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a possibility you may sit next to strangers.  But who cares when the  <START:Food> food <END>  is as YUMMY AS  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  IS!!!  The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  pretty basic but has many options for a Pasties.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Carne Adovada  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was AMAZING!  My Husband got the Pesto  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  raved about how  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was (didn't try because I do not like pesto).  We ended with  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  some  <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>  caramel  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was to die for!
Blue Martini Loves the Ladies!! ....and we love you too! HAPPY  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  4-7PM DailyHalf-off  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> 
Came with a friend and his girlfriend on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  recommendation about 2 weeks ago for AYCE cuz  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the best in town. We all  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the all you can eat and began indulging in skewers,  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , nigiri and just about  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was just okay to me and on numerous occasions our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  forgot a few of our  <START:Food> items <END> . For the same  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  for AYCE I would rather go to Sumo  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  2, and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's much closer to my house. The friends I went with who were raving about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  before we got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  had even said the  <START:Food> food <END>  wasn't as good  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  around.  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is cool, young and trendy with some good  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  playing. Not cool enough to get me to go back for AYCE though... Would only go back if I was invited by friends again. Nobody in Vegas can dethrone Sumo  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  2 for "Best AYCE in Vegas" in my honest opinion!
Worst pf changs I have ever been to. Sat down and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  were all over the  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  (dirty), then when the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  comes out my bowl was not clean, and lastly as my mother was eating our lo Mein  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  pulled out a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of paper!! GROSS!! At least the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  was nice enough to comp our  <START:Food> meal <END> , but at the same  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  insinuated we had put the  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of paper  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ??? Who knows. Just don't go  <START:Restaurant> there <END> !!!
Had been wanting to try The Outsider for awhile (saw  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  could do gluten free) and after soaking up some culture after day 2 at the museum, I had the chance.The blackboard  <START:Offers> specials <END>  looked promising and the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  did too with many  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  between £6.80 and £8.00 at  <START:S_OpenHours> lunchtime <END> .I had hoped to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  with a  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  over to the castle as I had my mum visiting but we had a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  at the front which turned out to be fab! The  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  are uber comfortable with masses of pillows.I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> mussels <END>  in a  <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> parmesan <END> , bacon and  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  and for a nice change  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  came with  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  instead of  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . My mum ( <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was girly Jubilee weekend) had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  belly in a red  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fabulous (I didn't try as I'm Gluten Free and wasn't sure  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was safe).Both were huge  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  and we both loved our  <START:Food> dishes <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were tons of  <START:F_FoodItem> mussels <END>  (only a couple  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END> ) and the pail of  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  seemed endless but fab with just the right amount of crispiness and some garlicky  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  seasoning.The Outsider was very busy -  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were friendly and seemed to cope. I would definitely return for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  as the  <START:Food> food <END>  is fab and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are reasonable (£4 a glass if  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , £2.50 for  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END> ) but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for a post museum  <START:Food> lunch <END> !
TERRIBLE!!!!!!! Went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on my birthday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  ONLY cuz we we're staying at the Imperial Palace! Wish I'd have read the reviews ahead of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .... Spent $42 on an Old Country  <START:Food> buffet <END>  ripoff!! Terrible  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> , uncomfortable  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> , poor  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> cuisine <END> ! DON'T GO!!!!!
A great  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  of fresh and seasonal  <START:Food> dishes <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's pretty much something for everyone  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
 <START:Service> service <END>  was very good.  I was a little confused by  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , but the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  explained  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to me.  I was quite pleased with the  <START:Food> food <END> .  Much better than expected for the  <START:Restaurant> location <END>  (in a strip center).
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a mediocre  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  Edible, but not great.  I won't throw a hissy-fit going  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , but I wouldn't go out of my way to find  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
Amazing! <START:Restaurant> this <END>  small  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Montreal had the most  <START:A_Env_Type> charming <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  and extremely well  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:Food> seafood <END> . I highly recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . You can select an assortment of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> mussels <END> , clams, octopus, choosing just a few or a bit of  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>  each perfectly then brings out several  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  to complement your options. I have to say, the  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> was so good I didn't add much in the way of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I also didn't add any  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> , which for me is unheard of. (I went with my mother who is not a fan of salty  <START:Food> foods <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  too, so I promise  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not too salty.)The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  added fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> lemon <END>  zest, and was generous in pouring the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> . Not to mention the entire  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly, entertaining, attentive, and welcoming. I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back!
I've never reviewed a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  before, but I really wanted to share my appreciation for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is my favourite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Waterloo and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is normally fantastic. On my most recent visit, one  <START:Food> item <END>  was slightly less superlative than usual, and when I commented on  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  to the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  not only came to apologize but also gave me a voucher  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  significantly  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  than I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  for my  <START:Food> meal <END>  in the first  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the best  <START:Service> service <END>  I have ever experienced, and in combination with the pleasant, sophisticated  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  and wonderful  <START:Food> food <END>  I would have no hesitation in unreservedly recommending the Bauer  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> .
What can I say about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  hasn't been said before? An amazing hidden culinary treasure,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  quaint  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  will have you coming back for  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END> . Family owned and French  <START:Food> cuisine <END>  inspired,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has some of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END>  I have had in Las Vegas.I first visited  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for a relaxed  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with my girlfriend while driving around town... And boy am I glad I did! Walking into  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you are immediately greeted with a warm  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  by the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  and by the sight of  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END>  and  <START:Service> treats <END> . From  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  to  <START:F_FoodItem> panini <END>  to creamy and tasty  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has something for everyone.We started off with a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  pesto  <START:F_FoodItem> panini <END>  and a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> squash <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , both of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  amazingly good. By the  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> of our  <START:Food> meal <END>  we could tell  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  is made fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  day (so the later you make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> , the slightly  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  limited your  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  might be) and prepared to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ! Please make sure to arrive hungry so you can try the peach or the pear  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END> ... You will love  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> .Note:  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a bit difficult to find so refer to the yelp profile picture which has the accurate  <START:Restaurant> location <END>  on  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Lastly, please beware  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  at 4pm, so  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  and  <START:Food> lunch <END>  spot.
So many  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  talk about the competitors around Sin City, but most of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  cannot even compare. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was endearing and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . I also appreciate the fact  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  when the uni was not up to standards  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  warned us, gave us a  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , and did not hold  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  against us when we did not like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  either.For starters;  <START:F_FoodItem> baby tako <END> , soft shell  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> , and baked green  <START:F_FoodItem> mussels <END>  are the way to go. As for  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , many of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  come heavily  <START:F_Ingredients> sauced <END> . I am not the biggest fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> , but the one's without kind of fell flat.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  need to meet somewhere in the middle. The Ugly was tasty, but three different  <START:A_Decor> dressings <END>  and the amount was overkill. The Sapporo Crunch  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  was one  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  stuck out because of all the different kind of  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> . The generous amounts of  <START:F_Ingredients> avocado <END>  and less  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was much appreciated.  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  hirame does not come with a ponzu or  <START:Food> anything <END> , so I could tell  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fresh.Now a  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END> , I have turned into a senior citizen and eat  <START:Food> dinner <END>  around 5.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was nice to meet some of my Yelpie friends  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for a late  <START:Food> dinner <END> . Even though I did not eat as much as I would if we had met earlier, I still left feeling full without feeling like dying. We sat until almost  <START:S_OpenHours> closing <END>  and no one rushed us out. The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  looks like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is ran by a family and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  definitely  <START:Service> treat <END>   <START:S_Staff> their <END>  guests well. I would make  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  a regular haunt.
First  <START:Food> things <END>  first,  <START:Food> food <END> / <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  was phenomenal (pretzels w/ multiple  <START:F_Ingredients> mustard <END>   <START:S_Menu> choices <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  pot pie is out of control - ask for some tabasco to take  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to the next level)One problem - I was not sure for  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>  the  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a gay  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ?? - the  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  (all dudes with schmedium t-shirts and the same crew cut) --  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is Las Vegas, not the castro, get with  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and hire a few knockouts to get behind  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and do you proud
My boyfriend surprised me with two  <START:S_OpenHours> nights <END>  at TSR for our anniversary. I have reviews of our  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of the  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  and the spa but wanted to write a separate review for  our  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  at Orange Sky.As my other reviews stated,  <START:Service> service <END>  at  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  overall is a bit mixed, maybe 2.5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  at best. When we checked in at the desk on the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>   <START:A_Places> floor <END>  before going up to the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , the man at the desk asked for our name and asked what  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  our  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  were for. We gave him the information and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  asked again what our name was. I could clearly see were next on his list of names. We repeated  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and then  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  just said 'ok', and another man walked over and hit the button to the elevator. No smiles from either, no 'have a nice  <START:Food> dinner <END> '. Neither one of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  said  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  to us and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  almost felt like we were interrupting  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  conversation. Upon arriving on the 15th  <START:A_Places> floor <END> , the hostest informed us  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  would be about 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  even though we were right on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . No big deal, we just took a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  in the  <START:A_Places> lounge area <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  to get a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . Our pre- <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  were okay but the  <START:Service> service <END>  was slow and without a smile.  What are these  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  so crabby about? In addition, rather than take our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  after having the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> 's for 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> , our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  for what seemed like forever for 4 glasses of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  to be filled for another  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and chatted with the other  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END> . Luckily once we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>   <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  fairly quickly and we were able to have one  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  before our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  was ready. Shortly thereafter, we were summoned to go with a hostest to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . We were lead through dancing couples on the dance  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  and were sat in the second  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  from the front.  The hostest never offered to pull out our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  made  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a bit awkward to get into but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was cozy once you sat down with all the pillows. We did have a nice  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and the way the  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  are positioned,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  makes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  feel very private... <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is unless you have a noisy group next to you on the other side of the divider. Ours weren't overly noisy but you could clearly hear  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were saying while we were busy eating.Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  friendly after striking up a conversation and all the  <START:Food> food <END>  was good. I had the  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with the  <START:F_FoodItem> filet <END>  and the bf  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with the ribeye. Not  <START:Food> anything <END>  particularly memorable but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was good. We were given a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  for our anniversary but can't say whether  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was free or not since I didn't  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  :)  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was good, some sort of  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  with hazelnuts with some very pretty penmanship wishing us happy anniversary.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the best  <START:Service> service <END>  related touch we had received the whole evening. We missed the sunset during  <START:Food> dinner <END>  which I'm sure would have added to the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  but watching highway traffic whiz by on the 101 after dark isn't overly romantic in my opinion. Even if  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are mountains in the  <START:A_OutsideView> background <END> . Overall though, given the mediocer  <START:Service> service <END>  at the front, the standard  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  affair on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and lack of  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  past dark, I can't say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I would go back.If you do decide to go anyway, make sure you go early enough to catch the sunset!
Cheapest Mexican  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  in town!!!  Great  <START:Food> food <END>  and ok  <START:Service> service <END> .  The one on Gibson is the best in my book.
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER  <START:Service> service <END> . (from " <START:Food> diners <END> , Drive-ins and Dives" to " <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Impossible!") I understand slow/busy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  - but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was straight up rudeness and we were ignored for over 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .we walked in (just two of us) in front of a group of four or so  <START:S_Staff> people <END> . The group  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came in behind us sat behind us as well, and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  before we even were acknowledged and got a glass of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> .We tried asking the male  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  continued past us (ignored us!) and helped the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  behind us, taking  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , bringing  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  several  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  then told us  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the other  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  would help us. we were continued to be ignored.i felt  <START:Opinion> bad <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> ' first day, but the other  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was of no assistance to  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  (or us), which made the entire  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  look  <START:Opinion> bad <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  kept walking past our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  to  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  and check on the group  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came behind us. <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  took 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for a glass of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and an additional 5 to get my  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END> . we  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  over a  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  (an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ) and about 50  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for a "wee"  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Meanwhile the group  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came in behind us has had a "not so wee"  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  ( <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> ), a couple  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , etc. and the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  kept bringing out  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  while we sat with one glass of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . The group of  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  behind us finished and  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  for  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  as our fricking  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  was coming out.the ONLY reason we didn't just walk away is human courtesy to the poor  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  first day.Looks like  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  needs to be on  <START:Food> food <END>  network again for the  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  " <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Impossible!" because the male  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was a complete ass - either  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  or  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was racist and ignored my boyfriend. I literally saw him make eye contact as we asked for help and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  kept  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  moving to the group just past us... <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came in after us!I will never come back, and i will never tell my out of town guests to come  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
I was a tad disappointed by  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  considering all the hype I heard about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was wonderful, very pleasant and efficient.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was good and if with a group, I would go back without whining. But  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was pretty ordinary.  My  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was a tad overcooked but still had good  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were the same, nothing to write home about.  My  <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END>  entitled black and white was really white, I think the waved the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  syrup bottle over the glass.  A little overpriced for my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> ......
The  <START:Food> food <END>  was good.  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is lacking. Not many options to choose from. I probably will not go back.
Great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Hot  <START:Food> food <END>  which is increasing rare to be  <START:Service> served <END>  these  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END> . Fresh and tasty,while the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  was  relaxing, sat on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  surrounded by tall palm trees lite with decorative  <START:A_Decor> lights <END> .The  <START:Service> service <END>  was friendly and prompt. Great for larger groups of  <START:S_Staff> people <END> .
A regular stop of mine when traveling through CLT.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is regularly of good  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> , the takeaway  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  is great, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are friendly and my  <START:Service> service <END>  is always quick. My most recent stop in was just last week - picked up a  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  for takeaway as I only had 30m between connecting flights.  The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in an open area of the  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  'between terminal  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> ' area so  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  isn't an enclosed  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  area - the closest you can get to  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  while being inside an airport terminal.  Being  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the customers are usually on the way to somewhere else, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are used to  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  at a pace to keep everyone moving  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seems.  Not in a pushy way to get you out, just swift enough to keep you moving on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to your final destination.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  won't make you sick and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a refreshing change from the usual fare of deep-fried and greasy  <START:Food> food <END>  you get in airport terminals.
Please do not  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  me mealy  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ....I live in NODA and I really want to start to like the places in my  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>  so I don't have to drive far and can walk!! Came in and sat up at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . The front  <START:A_Fur_Door> door <END>  is really beautiful (Old, wooden, big) the rest of the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is kinda like whatever...doesn't really look finished. Nice girl behind the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , asked  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  about some of the  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  let me try two one being the Cask  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , which surprisingly I liked but I would've liked  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a little colder. I know, I know I'm a silly American!!  We started with a pretzel  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was barely warm, but the  <START:F_Ingredients> mustard <END>  was good. Also had the homemade  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  with  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  were good but the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  had a weird  <START:Food> texture <END>  and was again not very warm. We then moved on and had the peel and eat  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  came in a pint glass and I could smell  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  from the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  sat in for a while.... <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were  <START:Opinion> bad <END> , WARM, mealy, fishy, and mushy!! I took  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  and put  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  about a  <START:A_Furniture> chair <END>  away from me because I thought I was going to get sick from the smell! In an attempt to get the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> out of our mouths we decided on the  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> . NO  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> at all, and once again not very warm!!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  being because the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were busy standing  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  talking and not ready to bring us our  <START:Food> food <END> ... <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  all were staring right at  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and continued to talk, then walked away, then came back for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ! Very frustrating, I almost got up to get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  myself! I mean  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  way I would have had  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was hot.....well maybe!!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had maybe 5  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  in  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  so not a very busy  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  I just thought  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  not being busy  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would've been better....I was wrong! The only saving grace to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  was when we got our check and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was thankfully not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  expensive!!
So we were trying to decide between a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of possible  <START:Food> lunch <END>  spots. A lot of our normal ones had been visited too recently or often, but somebody suggested to go for the non-usual Thai and specifically directed us  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .Not a  <START:Opinion> bad <END>  choice.We sat down at first, then we decided to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to-go in the interest of saving  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . I had my eye on the $7.95  <START:Food> lunch <END>  special and settled on a  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  pad thai.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  came with a side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  (fresh),  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  (decent, not salty or  <START:F_FI_Taste> bland <END> ),  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:Food> cream <END>  (well... no,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't for to-go, wtf?) and two potstickers (good). While I haven't  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the regular option for comparison purposes, the  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I got looked like a full  <START:Food> meal <END> , not reduced for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .Besides the lack of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:Food> cream <END> , my only real issue was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the fork tines were a little too small to make good work of the  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a little difficult to eat. The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was a little chewy, but not too  <START:Opinion> bad <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was actually  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I anticipated, so I wound up eating a lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and rationing  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  toward the end. Regardless, I'd definitely consider  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  again for a quick local Thai fix.
Came on a Saturday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  around 7 and were sat immediately.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a  <START:A_Env_Size> smaller <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  capable of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  15 or so and about 15  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . I'm not sure if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a nightly occurrence but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a gentleman playing on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:A_Ent_Music> piano <END>  and a young  <START:S_Staff> lady <END>   <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> singing <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  provided a nice  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> .The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  consists of apps,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , a few  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:Food> entrees <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . We had the stuffed  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  as an app and weren't too impressed.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  weren't terrible, just nothing special. The  <START:Food> entrees <END>  were a different story. My husband's  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lasagna <END>  was to die for.  Great  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> , perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  with just the right amount of each  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> veal parm <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  hit the spot.Veal was tender and had just the right amount of breading.  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> marinara <END>  is homemade and fantastic. I could've eaten  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with a spoon all on its own. The  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  was quite generous and was accompanied by  <START:F_FoodItem> spaghetti <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> marinara <END> . Our only compliant was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  do not offer draft  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  bottled  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  was very limited.While many  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  are not listed on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  informed us  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> marsalas <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> piccatas <END>  are available upon request.
I was pretty skeptical about the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  at first, since all the  <START:Food> item <END>  descriptions were pretty plain.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  turned out to be really flavorful and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , though!The  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is really  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END> -y with just the right amount of  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  didn't overpower all the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . We also had the braised  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  shoulder which was really tender and well-seasoned. The  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>  on top was a really nice contrast in  <START:Food> texture <END>  and gave  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a refreshing  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . Being serenaded by the live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on the canal was nice, despite the loud gaggles of Asian tourists snapping photos with  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  iPads.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was almost a 4- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  review, but I am docking a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  for the following reason:The  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  came out while my boyfriend was in the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END> , so I put my card in and  <START:O_Payment> paid <END> . When the check came back out for us to sign, the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  / host ( <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was checking  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  in but was also checking on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> , so I assume  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was some kind of  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> ) handed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to my boyfriend and said, "Thank you, Stephen."  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  may have been an innocent mistake, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  definitely came off as misogyny.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's the 21st century - women are allowed to pick up the tab once in a while. Poor form!
I am so disappointed. Let me preface  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  with saying the  <START:S_Staff> lady <END>   <START:S_Staff> owner <END> , who took our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  for take out was really, really friendly. Somehow the  <START:S_Staff> driver <END>  got the wrong address and went to the neighbors' house, but as luck would have  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , I was  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  and caught him.  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was also super  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END> .Now, the  <START:Food> food <END> . We like our  <START:Food> food <END>  HOT. HOT! Our  <START:S_Staff> gal <END>  had asked on a scale of 1-5 hot how did we like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . We said 10. We eat ghost  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> . We like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  HOT.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  laughed and said ok, no problem. The  <START:Food> food <END>  came quickly (and we are a bit away). We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rangoon puffs <END> , Hunan  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and hot and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . Sadly, the  <START:Food> food <END>  was not good at all. Not terrible, but not good. When we  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  hot, we expect  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  to be used.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  used  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  in the Hunan  <START:Food> dish <END>  and the hot and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was SOOOO greasy I had to wash the lids off of  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was everywhere. And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was not hot AT ALL. The Hunan  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> of the  <START:Food> dish <END>  would have been good, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was SOAKED in  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END> . The hot and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  had so much  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was floating on top. And  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  in the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . I am used to at least some  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> . Just  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was thick, which I like, but I had to scrape the  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  off the top. The  <START:F_FoodItem> rangoon puffs <END>  were tasty, but  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  came with no  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . And the  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  came with the fried  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  in a container by itself, with the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  on the side. Fine. I get  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't want  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  mushy when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  got  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . I like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . But  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was ONLY  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  in the container. No  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> , no  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> , no  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> , just the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was ok. But nothing to mix in with the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> .I give  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rating <END>  a 2 because the  <START:S_Staff> lady <END>  was EXTREMELY nice, and even called us back to apologize for the  <START:S_Staff> driver <END>  having the wrong address and stating  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  wanted to update  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  system so  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  right the next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . When  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  called, after we had eaten, we told  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  our  <START:Food> food <END>  was NOT spicy at all, as promised, but said next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  would do better.I will give  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  another chance because of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  customer  <START:Service> service <END>  and how lovely the  <START:S_Staff> lady <END>  was. But let's hope  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  doesn't come with a pound of  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  in and on  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> . I am so disappointed. I was excited to try  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  turned out to be like almost all of the Chinese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in town.Dear Golden  <START:S_Staff> chef <END> ,Please, please, please! Use  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> , NOT  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END> . And add something to your  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> . Because the  <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  itself was pretty tasty. And your customer  <START:Service> service <END>  was so wonderful. :( :(
My friends and I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to try  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  prefixe  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Week; however, we  <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  a bit too late and missed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Instead, the three of us shared the grilled octopus for the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END>  for  <START:Food> entree <END> , and  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  dark  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  Nutella flourless  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  great and  <START:Food> dishes <END>  were perfect  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  for three  <START:S_Staff> people <END> .The octopus and  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  very well, both prepared with  <START:F_Ingredients> lemon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> capers <END> . Some  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  have complained about the bones in the  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END>  but  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were removed when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END>  to us. We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  came out to $100 each including tip. If you don't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the signature  <START:Food> dishes <END>  for the  <START:Food> entree <END> , you can walk over to  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  little " <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  market" and choose something else to be  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  up for you. Thought  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was interesting. I would definitely come back and try something  from  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . Love how  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  is fresh!
So so so good! I had the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and I enjoy  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> ! Great design of a  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . So well done.
The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I tried Spinato's  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was when my friend introduced me to  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with carryout over the summer.  We went with the thin  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and I really enjoyed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I was in town I stopped in and tried the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  itself, and really had a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .I don't know what  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was before, but I swear  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  used to be a  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> 's. I could be wrong, but either way, its really well  <START:A_Decor> decorated <END> .  Warm well  <START:A_Decor> decorated <END>   <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  with a full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and a great  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Lots to choose from, and not just  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  (even though its  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  specialty.)I really like the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Not overstated, but classy enough  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you can take your parents  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and not have  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  freak out like mine do.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  feels like a great date spot too.   <START:Service> service <END>  was great, and I really had a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I had were tasty.  I would come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again in a heartbeat. Check  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out,  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the trip if you want something different and want to have a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  review is courtesy of my fellow yelpers.Typed in " <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> ", "Las Vegas", and "Highest Rated" and Carlo's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  popped up.Eh, why not? Great reviews and the fan photos really helped making the final dining decision very easy.Inside of Charlie's  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , say what? Who would have known such a  <START:Food> stellar <END>   <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>  could be found nestled inside of a typical Vegas pub? Yelpers,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's who!No sooner did my party get sat our very attentive  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  came to grab our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> .  Glasses never empty and our palates totally satisfied we thoroughly enjoyed our  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at Carlos.From succulent  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  chops to perfectly seasoned  <START:F_FoodItem> fettuccine <END>  and a goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  fritta  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  will make you want thirds, you will not be disappointed.Take away the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  aspect of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  the point has been made  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  is out of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  world; lets get to my most favorite part of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .. The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  in charge of all  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  leave the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  personally came out to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ! Not only did  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  come out to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  us at the beginning of our  <START:Food> meal <END>  but  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  checked on our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  of (7) after our feeding frenzy came to a  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to follow up.A brilliant display of customer  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I honestly thought was completely lost in  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  city.Thank you Carlo's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  for bringing back the feel of an old world dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  where  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  feels like the entire  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  actually gives a crap about creating a positive dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .You will see us again for sure!
I just moved to Charlotte and I'm very happy to announce... I've found my brunch  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Terrace  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  is the bomb.com and I know I will definitely be back to try some of the other  <START:Food> things <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . I live in Rock Hill but drove to Ballantyne in search of some yummy brunch. I had tried  a couple hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  places near Rock Hill but none were  <START:Food> anything <END>  to write home about.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  most definitely did not disappoint.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a Monday morning, so I can't really comment on what the weekend  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  is like but we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  immediately. The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  was nice; trendy but casual. Good for girlfriends, a brunch date with your significant other or even  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  with the kids.  <START:Service> service <END>  was pretty good. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  checked in a few times and our  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END>  in a good amount of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .I started with a Salted Caramel Latte. YUM. I saw  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon bloody mary <END> , but I'm going to save  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  for a Sunday Funday. For the  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:Food> entree <END> , I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> hashbrowns <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> . DAMN. The  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  were out of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  world. The  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  fresh and fluffy, while the  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  was definitely homemade and very flavorful. The  <START:F_FoodItem> hashbrowns <END>  were a little salty, but I like salty.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were also very crisp.  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  was fresh a good  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> grapes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> raspberries <END>  - I don't really like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  average  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  with just melon &  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> , so I was pleased. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  also had some very interesting  <START:Food> items <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  Benedict, Buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and a Red Velvet Waffle  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I would love to try.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  may be a little premature to say  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the best  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  in Charlotte but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's definitely a solid standby. If you're looking for a  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .
Love love love Dim Sum needed a fix and didn't want to drive across town to get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  So we pull up and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  don't open till  <START:S_OpenHours> 10:30 <END>  : / my  <START:Opinion> bad <END>  for not checking first.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a farmers market on  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  day right down the way.  So we wasted some  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  until  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  opened.Starving by the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we get in and I know better the to be some of the first few customers for DimSum : /   The  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  was nill to none again my  <START:Opinion> bad <END> .  So we got a few of our favorites and by the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  the good stuff was coming out we were full.The  <START:Food> food <END>  we did have was good, very flavorful and prepared well.  The  <START:F_FI_Size> sizes <END>  of the Dim Sum  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we got seemed larger then normal.  The  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  were a bit  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  expensive then China Town but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is in a higher rent district, so understandable.I don't know if I will be back but in a pinch I would.
We choose a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>  for consistency but when the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is full of the part no one wants to eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  ruins the whole  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Please cut the fat, literally!
Had the country fried  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was awesome! Red velvet  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  with the  <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  syrup!
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the definition of the American Diet. Huge  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  for really heavy  <START:Food> foods <END> . Out of all the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> , we really liked the philly  <START:F_FoodItem> cheesesteak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> & <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> . We'd stay away from the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> . Huge  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Who doesn't want  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  in Vegas.
padlocked and  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  with an eviction notice taped to the front  <START:A_Fur_Door> door <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> location <END>  is quite  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to work, and at times when morale is low or  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  feels like  <START:S_Staff> he <END> 's been kind of a jerk lately, the boss will get us a couple  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  from Frank's  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . I have had some regular old pepperoni  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  in the past, and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were definitely better than average. But the famed buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .... Oh boy. The  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>  is flavorful and at the perfect level of chewiness, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  chunks are large and tender, the buffalo  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is spicy and not too greasy, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  blankets all in wonderfulness. Then you get sides of  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's homemade!  Thick and rich and you can  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  all the lovely dill  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 've put in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's the best dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  ever.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was so good  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I felt indebted to the  <START:S_Staff> boss man <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  wonderful  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  and volunteered to stay late. Perhaps  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  will be positive reinforcement and  <START:S_Staff> he <END> 'll buy me  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  often.
Hands down the best  <START:Food> buffet <END>  on the strip. Wicked Spoon is amazing, but Baccahanal blows even  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  out of the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . I can't imagine coming to Vegas again and not eating  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
Had  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .
Stayed at Encore. Andrea's was the best  <START:Food> meal <END>  on our trip. The  <START:Service> service <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  were the best. The rock  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>  and the mango  <START:F_Ingredients> avocado <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , and the strip  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  with wasabi Demi glaze was also very good. Definitely coming back !
The  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>  expert in me wants to cringe when I eat the  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> . LOL But I also know  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I'm not in Japan or California, and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is probably better than most  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>  places in Tempe.Well,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's better than Republic  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> ... if  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is saying much? However,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's probably from the same  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  of Republic  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END> , the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and the style is just too similar. And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just as expensive. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> .... no  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was $8. Additional  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  are at least $1 per  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is ridiculous.I don't know where these  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  learned to make  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>  but please.... no  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  ruins the  <START:Food> texture <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> of the  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END> . I don't even want to ask why  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  available as a  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END> . I'll just get annoyed. -______-Better off going back to Cherry Blossoms for  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>  (which actually  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like Japanese  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> ).
Best Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  ever! I have been going to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for years and i love the new  <START:Restaurant> location <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  just the same and I wish I could go  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  day.I always get the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  mango quesadilla.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is very popular for a reason ;)
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ....I really am a fan of Gus' s  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ...The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and customer  <START:Service> service <END>  is awesome.   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is fast and very clean!! Hope you get to enjoy Gus' s  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  soon!!!
Wow!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is absolutely incredible! I came in on a Thursday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't super packed, Senator Harry Reid had just came in with his wife to eat. One of the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  was so amazing and I had some of the best  <START:Service> service <END> . I split the Combo Special and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was so good, but did have a lot of  <START:Food> food <END> . We got complimentary  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  on the house and THE PITA  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  WAS UNBELIEVABLE!  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's house made and cannot be missed. Definitely coming back for  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END> !!!
