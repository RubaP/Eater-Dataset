Visited this Sonic fast  <START:Food> food <END>  estsblishment last night as the little one wanted a  <START:F_FoodItem> corn   dog   <END> . Drove through and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  some  <START:Food> selections <END>  to  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> take home <END> . Little one took the  <START:F_FoodItem> corn   dog   <END>  out and exclaimed how small  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was. In fact he said I hope  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  is two!  ( <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were half the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of any  <START:F_FoodItem> corn   dog   <END>  we ever saw!) Little one then started pealing the breading off the  <START:F_FoodItem> corn   dog   <END>  (which he likes to eat last) revealing a very  <START:F_Ingredients> blackened <END>  skinney little Weiner about the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of my pointing finger. Cant believe  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  this burnt shriveled half  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>    <START:F_FoodItem> wenie <END>  to anyone. Sonic should be deeply ashamed. I also had some  <START:F_FoodItem> popcorn   chicken   <END>  that was  <START:F_Ingredients> overbreaded <END>  and tasteless. Ugh.! If for some reason you like sonic,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  must not be for  <START:Food> anything <END>  we   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . My first and last  <START:Restaurant> visit <END>  for sure.
RA is ok.... I like to go to HH but if u don't  <START:Food> get <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  early,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  starts to  <START:Food> get <END>  real loud. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is usually great, the  <START:F_FoodItem> crunchy   calamari     roll   <END>  is my favorite. I also usually  <START:Food> get <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> gyoza <END> , Tootsy Maki, &  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END>  Dynamite  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> .   <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  are decent during HH... Last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went the  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  smelled weird :(
Fellow hikers and I stopped  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  Elvira's Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  on a recent Saturday after a hike up Gold Canyon to see the petroglyphs. Mexican is one of my favorite  <START:Food> food <END>  groups, so I won't say "no" to trying a new  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ! (And certainly not after just having torched 1,019 calories hiking before  <START:Food> lunch <END> ...)We arrived  <START:S_Delivery> right <END>  around  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and were  <START:S_Del_Time> quickly <END>  accommodated with  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and  <START:A_Furniture> chairs <END>  pulled together for our group. The  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>   <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is very bright and colorful; we found ourselves looking around  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  all the different  <START:A_Decor> art <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem>   green chile     beef   chimichanga <END>  with double  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  (no  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> ). The  <START:F_Ingredients> green chile <END>  gave  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a different  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  than I'm used to, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was really good. The added  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> sour cream <END>  made for a perfect combination. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  were excellent too. The  <START:A_Plc_RestRoom> restrooms <END>  are  <START:A_Plc_RestRoom> one-holers <END> , so if you have a group who, say, just came from hiking Gold Canyon and say, all have to go the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END> , well...make sure you  <START:Food> get <END>  in the  <START:A_Fur_Door> door <END>  first. We had great  <START:Service> service <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't too  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END>  on a Saturday for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . I recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !
We  <START:Ambience> affectionately <END>  refer to  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  Bell as  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  Hell. Sometimes  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:Food> get <END>  your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:S_Delivery> right <END>  and sometimes  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't. Just make sure you  <START:Food> check <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  before you leave. This one has an  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  which is nice when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Type> cool <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  in Arizona.
Only popped in for a few  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  on a Sunday afternoon. Caught in-between the two Happy Hours, ended up with two $ <START:F_FI_Price> 4.50 <END>  Blue Moons. Bartender was Leslie and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was very nice and upon wandering around the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was pretty impressed with the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  and other nooks and crannies like the small upstairs  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  and sneaky small first  <START:A_Places> floor <END>   <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> . Upstairs also had  <START:A_Places> pool <END>  and lots of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  and no kiddies allowed up  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END> . Had a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  and was watching some of the action in the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  during my  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:Restaurant> visit <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  appears similiar to another  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , so this must be part  of a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> . I remember the "Foccaccia"  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  is really a  <START:F_FoodItem> wrap <END>  made with  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  dough and has nothing to do with the real  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . French  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  are said to be fresh cut, but  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  were fryers full of  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  ready to dipped upon  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  - so not sure about that claim. Very big  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to watch  <START:A_Entertainment> sports <END>  as well.
I saw a someone praise this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  on Facebook and I started chuckling. My wife asked me to go with  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  to the  <START:Restaurant> melting pot <END>  a couple years ago.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was very excited until the  <START:Food> food <END>  actually came. That's when  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said, this isn't what we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . I said yeah  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  is less then 4 oz of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  to share between 2 people.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said, no I meant these are the wrong  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> . I said hang on. We are  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> 120 dollars <END>  for 2 cups of raw  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> , 4 oz of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  stock?  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said well your  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> . Plus  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>  is to die for.  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>  came,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said Isn't this great and I said we are dipping less then a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  in  <START:Food> chocolate <END> .  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the end  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said you hated  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , didn't you. I said baby I loved being  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  with you, but I have never  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  so much  <START:W_Price> money <END>  in all my life to eat every day  <START:Food> food <END>  and stay hungry. For the same  <START:W_Price> money <END>  we could have gone to any number of nice  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  and actually had a full  <START:Food> meal <END> .  My wife laughed and then said yeah your  <START:S_Delivery> right <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a great little niche  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  idea, but once you  <START:Food> get <END>  past all the hoopla this is  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a huge rip off.  On the plus side,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a nice romantic  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with super dark  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . Cooking your own  <START:Food> food <END>  gives you plenty of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to sit and talk with that  <START:Offers> special <END>  someone.
 <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  chow fun for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  today.  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  was good but a little lacking as well as a bit on the greasy side. Came out to about $ <START:F_FI_Price> 8 <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  could probably feed two.
I always have a good  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's very well  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  with an interesting  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . My only thing is that  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's tough with all the different  <START:Food> items <END>  on the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would be easier if all the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  on the  <START:A_Decor> walls <END>  were on a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  <START:Food> seafood <END>  is always fresh and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have Japanese comfort fare too like udon.
Not the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  I was expecting.   <START:Food> food <END>  was average  <START:Service> service <END>  was good but overpriced.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  boiled the one good thing the  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were fab.  Won't be returning to this  <START:Ambience> establishment <END> .
Ugh. The friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  gets  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> four   stars   <END>  but the  <START:Ambience> building <END>  is atrocious.  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is beyond tacky,  <START:A_Places> elevators <END>  are scary, and the whole  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  needs an upgrade badly. Yeah, sure its cheap and not the MGM but the only reasons that I can think of anyone wanting to stay  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  is if  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're really tight on budget or just  <START:Food> want <END>  to ogle young girls in ridiculous outfits while  <START:A_Entertainment> gambling <END> .  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  least the  <START:A_Places> rooms <END>  don't seem to have bedbugs.
We stopped  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and the weather had the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  closed which was a bummer.  The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is great and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was good.  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>   <START:O_Experience> enjoyed <END>   <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  and had a great  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  I would recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  after checking out the  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  stations.
A small English  <START:Restaurant> pub <END>  tucked away in  an alley behind harris teeter.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a huge  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Places> eating area <END> .  The inside has a large community  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  in the back for when the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  gets  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have an extensive  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END> .  As far as the  <START:Food> food <END>  goes you have to be very careful.  I have tried many  <START:F_FoodItem> things <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and I have only been impressed by the  <START:F_FoodItem>   bacon     cheeseburger   <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> .  But, the  <START:F_FoodItem>   bacon     cheeseburger   <END>  is the best you'll  <START:Food> get <END>   <START:Restaurant> anywhere <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is also very affordable.
I am not a  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>  but I am a big fan! Not your typical Indian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with its  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  curry  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and so on. A lot  <START:W_Price> more <END>  interesting South India  <START:Food> cuisine <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is not fancy but the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  is really nice and the  <START:Food> food <END>  really interesting! Went  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  4 times in the last 2 months and the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  is consistent.
This little mexican joint has to have the best, mouth  <START:F_Drinks> watering <END> , orgasmic  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  tongue  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  on the face of this planet.  My pastor introduced me to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  while my friend and I were starving in our little office ready to devour every thing we laid eyes on.I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  6  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  tongue  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  and I tell you  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 'S AMAZING!!  The  <START:F_FoodItem> tortillas <END>  are made fresh in front of your eyes and the tongue must of been braised for hours upon hours.  Because the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  just melts in your mouth.  Matter a fact  <START:Food> get <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> .  You'll  <START:Food> get <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and is cheaper.With your  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  that you purchase you also receive a roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeno <END> .  On the side if you  <START:Food> want <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pickled <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> jalapenos <END>  or  <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END> , radishes, amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> salsas <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're available.If you truly  <START:Food> want <END>  a delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  drop by any, I think  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Price> 8 <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> locations <END>  in Phoenix?  Don't eat the Americanized  <START:F_FoodItem> chipotle <END>  junk.  This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  blows  <START:F_FoodItem> chipotle <END>  out of the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> .
I have no idea how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  ever received a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4   star   <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rating <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was below mediocre first of all  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had a very distinct smell in the whole  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was not a very  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizing <END>  one that's for sure. Secondly the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  only came by twice once to  <START:Food> get <END>  our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and the second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to bring out the  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  never bothered checking up on us or  <START:Food> anything <END>  we actually had to flag someone else down just to  <START:Food> get <END>  a refill. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was ok I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two  <START:F_FoodItem> blueberry   pancakes   <END>  with an  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  as well as a half  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of the  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  tasted as if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  used a Bisquick mix and tossed in some unripe  <START:F_Ingredients> blueberries <END>  which was very disappointing because I usually LOVE  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  out. The  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  on the other hand were much better but still not good enough to bring me back . John had the  <START:F_FoodItem> country fried   steak   <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> hashbrowns <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> . He said the  <START:F_FoodItem> country fried   steak   <END>  itself wasn't bad but not his favorite, the  <START:F_FoodItem> hashbrowns <END>  despite having  <START:Food> them <END>  topped with  <START:F_Ingredients> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> onions <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> peppers <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapenos <END>  were very  <START:F_FI_Quality> bland <END>  and needed a good dash of  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> . Overall you would be much  <START:W_Price> more <END>  satisfied going to your  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>  Denny's than Hoosier Cafe in my opinion.
I stopped by  <START:S_Del_Time> quickly <END>  the other day before my  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> at <END>  The Herb Box for a quick  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and  <START:O_Experience> enjoyed <END>  a delicious  <START:F_Drinks> cherry   cocktail   <END>  that the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  promised wouldn't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like a  <START:F_Drinks> cherry popsicle <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was  <START:S_Delivery> right <END> . The last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I had been  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  was for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  but that was probably seven years ago. A repeat  <START:Restaurant> visit <END>  is definitely in  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_Drinks> cocktails <END>  are delicious and  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is lively.
I've been coming  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  for years - dating back to when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was in an  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>   <START:Restaurant>   coffee     shop   <END>  on Scottsdale Road before  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  moved into the current Bat Cave - and the  <START:Food> food <END>  never disappoints. The stacked  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  are my favorite, complete with the fried  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  on top to make  <START:Food> everything <END>  better. The  <START:Restaurant> carne avobada <END>  is always tender, and all of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  pack plenty of heat.  <START:Service> service <END>  is friendly. You can't come to Scottsdale and not eat  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>   <START:Restaurant> at <END>  least once.
 <START:Food> everything <END>  LOOKED fun..Its all broken.  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:W_Price> worth <END>  a damn is out of  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . Waste of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
why go any where else?  <START:Food> food <END>  is the best on the strip, best executed, <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list rocks with interesting  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> , and the  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  is well, the best in Vegas
One of the few  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  I have stored in my phone. This particular  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is open 24/7. If you already know what you  <START:Food> want <END> , I'd recommend calling  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  in, as  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  can  <START:Food> get <END>  busy. As a  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END> , I'd say  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are amazing.  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  is my favorite (take  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to go and add Famous Dave's Devil Spit bbq  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  to  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , trust me). The  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cole   turkey   <END>  is awesome too, just tell  <START:Food> them <END>  to go easy on the  <START:Restaurant> mayo <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  drown  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem>   burger     sandwich   <END>  is a garden  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> patty <END> , good if you like  <START:F_FoodItem> garden   burgers   <END> . You can also  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> bobbie <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the $2  <START:W_Price> more <END>  than the  <START:Restaurant> subway <END>  across the street, that's for sure.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also sell really good  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> , I'd recommend the Walker's Honey BBQ. Writing this review makes me  <START:Food> want <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:S_Delivery> right <END>  now!!
Super yummy  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  rings.  Good  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  too which seems to be a rarity in Vegas.  We had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  about  <START:S_Del_Time> 20   minutes   <END>   <START:Restaurant> at <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  on a Monday, so I would be prepared for a  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> .Sadly, our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was not the sharpest knife in the drawer thus taking away a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 5   star   <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rating <END> .  Best  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  I've had in a long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  though!Oh, and  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  was someone famous  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  when we were  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END> .  But we were too lame or hungover to know who  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was.  Still,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  must be a good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to scope out celebs...if you can figure out who  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are.
Being the only  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  in Arizona the Rainforest Cafe  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the Arizona Mills  <START:A_LocatedArea> mall <END>  automatically earns itself a positive reputation. However, the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> 's success and appeal are also a result of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> 's fun-oriented  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  as well as its individuality.As mentioned earlier, Rainforest Cafe is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>   <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the Arizona Mills  <START:A_LocatedArea> mall <END>  in Tempe, a large  <START:A_LocatedArea> mall <END>  different from other malls in Arizona.  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  are plenty of  <START:F_FoodItem> things <END>  to do  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  because the  <START:A_LocatedArea> mall <END>  is home to a Harkins IMAX movie theater and a Gameworks in addition to all of the stores. The assortment of available activities makes the  <START:A_LocatedArea> mall <END>  a good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to plan an entire day of events. This is exactly what my girlfriend and I did for our one-year anniversary; we started off the day with a  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the Rainforest Café, strolled around the  <START:A_LocatedArea> mall <END>  for a while, and then saw a movie  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the Harkins. All in all,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  proved to be an entertaining day, and the highlight of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was our fun-filled  <START:Restaurant> visit <END>  to the Rainforest Cafe.The setting of the Rainforest Cafe is similar to that of an amusement  <START:A_Places> park <END>  rather than a regular  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , and is the main reason that people choose to  <START:Restaurant> visit <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was designed to look like a tropical rainforest, and is filled with  <START:A_Decor> artificial trees <END> ,  <START:A_Decor> animatronic animals <END> , and large  <START:A_Environment> aquariums <END>  filled with live  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> . Fake fog and  <START:A_Decor> thunderstorms <END>  add to the wild vibe, and provide an entertaining  <START:A_Environment> environment <END>  different from other  <START:Restaurant> locales <END> . Because of its similarity to amusement  <START:A_Places> parks <END>  such as Disneyland, the Rainforest Cafe is popular among families and teenagers looking to have a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . As a result, the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is often filled with loud, energetic children, which can be annoying but also adds to the overall mood because  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  antics are similar to those of the electronic gorillas that periodically cause an uproar in  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Besides, since most of the people dining  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  are  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  to have a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  does little to disturb  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Restaurant> visit <END> .In terms of  <START:Service> service <END> , Rainforest Cafe is just average;  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  often appear rushed and a little confused, which is understandable because the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is always so busy. However,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are always friendly and willing to help, making up for  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  overwhelmed  <START:Service> service <END> .The only fault of the Rainforest Cafe is the  <START:O_Pay_Price> pricing <END> , which is a little excessive considering that the majority of the  <START:Food> items <END>  are of common  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . But the  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  are not so extreme that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  take away from the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> 's appeal because the unique  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  offered by this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  a little extra.
 <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4   stars   <END>  for the  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  Market  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END> .   I'm being slightly generous but these  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4   stars   <END>  make sense in context of the fact that we're talking about a Las Vegas  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END> .   I'm not even comparing this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with Picasso across the street or any "honest"  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , for that matter.   When one accounts for the fact, though, that this is an all-you-can-eat  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  Market  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  should evidently  <START:Food> get <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4   stars   <END> .Other reviewers have already mentioned this:   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a wide  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of different  <START:Food> cuisines <END> :   <START:Food> seafood <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , Italian, American, Asian, Middle Eastern, Mexican, and  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> .   This means you can  <START:Food> get <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> sushi <END>  to start with, then load up  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  benedicts, then switch over and  <START:Food> get <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> lox <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cream   cheese   <END> , then  <START:Food> get <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> quesadilla <END>  or some  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> , and finish  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  up with a couple of  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> .   We didn't  <START:Food> get <END>  an opportunity to try nearly that many  <START:Food> foods <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> , but this is just to illustrate the  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:Food> foods <END>  that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END> .I started with  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lox <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cream   cheese   <END> , incidentally.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  was really extremely good.   I also tasted  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  benedict and  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem>   crab   benedict <END> , and I gotta say the  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  benedict was quite good.   The  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  one... only so so.   <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was *SERIOUS* disappointment, as was  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> sushi <END> .  Let's just say that I didn't even touch the  <START:F_Appetizer> sushi <END> :  my wife got  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  for me as  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  knows I love  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , but just eyeing the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , I knew  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was probably not even close to fresh and didn't really feel like spending my Vegas weekend puking, so I left  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  with a  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> -based  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and was way tastey!   Finally,  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  was astounding.   I had the  <START:Food> tiramisu <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  really was quite a  <START:Service> treat <END> !$20 a head for sunday brunch...  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's pricey, but then again you're gonna eat a lot of different  <START:Food> foods <END>  and lots of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , so that'll basically be your one  <START:Food> meal <END>  for the day.    <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> -wise, I guess  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .As far as  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is concerned,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's quite tragic.   I think I've felt  <START:W_Price> more <END>  warmth kickin'  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the Ritz Carlton men's  <START:A_Plc_RestRoom> restrooms <END>  than I did in this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .    <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's open  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END> , very ugly  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END> ... just tragic  <START:A_Decor> decoration <END> .Also, watch out for serious white trash contingency  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> .   This couple took our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and switched receipts because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  apparently weren't pleased with where  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 'd been placed by the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END> .  Puzzled, I asked the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  who looked worse than a bulldog if he might have mistakenly sat  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the wrong  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .   He sorta grunted and went back to sucking his  <START:Food> food <END>  out of his  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> .   The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  looked so grungy and smelly I frankly wasn't gonna argue.  Probably sitting back in that  <START:A_Furniture> chair <END>  I'd have caught some nasty disease.    Anyway, that was a bit of a downer on our brunch since both my wife and I felt slightly freaked out  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  this episode.  We tried to sit as far away from  <START:Food> them <END>  as we could but, sadly,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't far enough.   So yeah, watch out for the white trash that seems to hang out  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> .   Then again, most of the other  <START:F_Drinks> patrons <END>  looked normal enough.  Still, looks can be deceiving.
I do adore the weekend  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END>  brunch, but not for the  <START:Food> food <END>  - for the  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END> , of course!  The  <START:Food> food <END> ...well, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is "eh"  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  best, and inedible  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  worst.  The  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  is extensive and covers nearly any palette, but because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's done in such a mass quantity and left to sit out, is not particularly fresh or hot.  The  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  mostly had a rubbery consistency,  <START:Offers> save <END>  for the tasty  <START:F_FoodItem> peach cobbler <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pecan   rolls   <END> .  The  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is also a very safe bet.Steer clear of the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ... <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> -temperature and slimy on the skin, so we had to pass after a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> , for fear we'd  <START:Food> get <END>  sick.  Most  <START:Food> everything <END>  was heat-lamped too long and was too dry to enjoy, but if my tip would be to sit  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  with  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  of the  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  - you can watch  <START:Food> them <END>  put out new  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and run over to  <START:Food> get <END>   <START:Food> them <END>  fresh.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  won't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  delicious, but  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  least  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 'll be  <START:S_Delivery> consumed <END>  straight-from-the-oven.I have heard that the  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  is better, but for the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END>  brunch, I expected that the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  would suffer, so I wasn't disappointed when this came to fruition.However, for the $30 or whatever  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was, the ability to sit in a garden-of-eden-meets-Mad-Hatter-tea-party  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  with the  <START:A_Env_Type> sun streaming <END>  in, nibbling some  <START:Food> food <END>  and drinking  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END>  was well  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  tag.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a great way to spend a Sunday morning  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the Wynn.So grab a  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END> , settle in, and, if you really  <START:Food> want <END>  good  <START:Food> food <END> , stick to the fresh-made stations like the  <START:F_FoodItem> omelets <END> , or just go  <START:Restaurant> somewhere else <END> .
WOW!  I mean WOW!  Entered the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>   <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the end of the brunch/ <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  so when we got to our seconds  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were placing out  <START:Food> dinner <END> !  FOR THE  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> !!!! Excellent savings. <START:Service> service <END>  is as amazing as  <START:Food> everything <END>  else in the Wynn/Encore.  Beautiful floral and  <START:A_Environment> fauna <END>   <START:Ambience> everywhere <END>  inside.The  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazing!  So many  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> .My favorites were: King  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs with clarified  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> , Prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END> , Fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , Freshly tossed Caesar  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ....who am I kidding,  <START:Food> everything <END>  was so frickin delicious!We sat  <START:S_Delivery> right <END>  by the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:A_Furniture> windows <END> .  I tore that up!!  Gelato -  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  & mango =wow yummy!  Candied  <START:F_FoodItem> apples <END>  - never been a fan, but these are really good.  Cheesecake was so creamy.  Creme brulee with the hard shell was amazing!   Can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back.  So  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> !
Anyone from the east coast that does not  <START:Restaurant> visit <END>  an In and Out  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  when visiting the west coast is a fool.   <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> ... that's  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do  <START:Food> them <END>  fresh and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do  <START:Food> them <END>   <START:S_Delivery> right <END> .  I rent a car just to insure I  <START:Food> get <END>  to  <START:Restaurant> visit <END>  one.
Better than L&L, nowhere near as good as Dakine's or Keilani's.
I used to LOVE Dave's (see previous  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4   star   <END>  reviews from earlier this year) but  <START:Food> something <END>  changed. The last few times I've gone  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  is not as good as  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  used to be and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is slipping as well. Turnover in help? Change in  <START:S_Staff> management <END> ? Just another got-too-big-for-our-britches story? Your guess is as good as mine..First  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , instead of being hot and fresh, tender and juicy,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was warm and dried out, as if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had been left under a heat lamp or reheated in a microwave. The baby back  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  used to be fat and meaty, lately  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are lean and fatty/tough. Then the  <START:Service> service <END>  started to be less than friendly and careless, twice I received the wrong  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and had to return to  <START:Food> get <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  fixed.The last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END> , figuring I'd give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  another try as  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  has "off" days, was the final straw. The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was dried out and  <START:F_FI_Quality> stringy <END> , the Wilbur's  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  were soured (gone bad, gone over, whatever)..as if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had been not refrigerated and stored properly and reheated many times over. I was sick from eating just two  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END>  was full of tough inedible  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END>  stalk pieces (either someone just doesn't care or  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are really cutting  <START:F_FI_Price> costs <END> ) and an overabundance of  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeno <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> peppers <END>  which overwhelmed the usually  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END> /hot balance of the  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END> .Having a bad day is one thing, bad  <START:Food> food <END>  that makes people sick is entirely a different animal and is indicative of a  <START:W_Price> more <END>  serious issue going on  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  is absolutely NO excuse for  <START:Food> food <END>  improperly stored or  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  that is full of bacteria.Famous Dave...PLEASE WAKE UP AND FIX YOUR PROCESS before  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's too late!!!
This used to be my favorite  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>  for YEARS. I'm talking  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 5   stars   <END>  as far as  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  joints go. Then last week, I saw the  <START:S_Staff> cook <END>  use the  <START:F_Ingredients> spatula <END>  to finish up my  <START:Food> carnitas <END> ,  <START:S_Delivery> right <END>  after he had just used the same  <START:F_Ingredients> spatula <END>  to put raw  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> griddle <END> !!! I have friends who are  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would be FIRED for doing exactly that in most  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> . Cross contamination isn't taken lightly by me and I will NEVER give Roberto's  <START:Food> food <END>  to my kids.** I've contacted Roberto's and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  wrote back saying  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 'll take care of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Whatever that means.As for the  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  give you a lot of bang for the buck. Machaca  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> torta <END>  has shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  with two fried  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  in  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's loaded with  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's only $3.50.  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  condiment  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is loaded with  <START:F_FoodItem> pickled <END>  jalapeños &  <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> lime <END> , green  <START:F_Ingredients> onions <END> , radishes,  <START:F_Ingredients> cucumbers <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  verde &  <START:F_Ingredients> roja <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's kept clean and fresh.One of Roberto's sons once told me that this Roberto's is  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> busiest <END> , hence  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's open 24 hrs and is very clean. That's why I was shocked to see what I saw in the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> .
 <START:S_Staff> their <END>  AYCE is pretty good  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  is sometimes slow, but I keep coming  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not that bad!  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're a bit pricey, but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:Offers> offer <END>  some pretty good  <START:S_Menu> options <END> . I've liked most  <START:F_FoodItem> things <END>  that I've had  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  with the exception of  <START:F_FoodItem> calamari <END>  (which was an error in my part for  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  from a  <START:F_Appetizer> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> !!). I love  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  udon, I  <START:Food> get <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  everytime!!
I'm not really a fan of Toby Keith but I can't help liking a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that plays nonstop country  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  (that said, I can totally understand why someone who doesn't LOVE country  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  would go a bit nuts  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> ). I also like deep fried  <START:F_FoodItem> things <END> . I came  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  with a bunch of girls from work who share the same love of all  <START:F_FoodItem> things <END>  country  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  (I grew up  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> dancing <END>  to Brooks and Dunn if that explains  <START:Food> anything <END> ... and yes, I know I'm Asian and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's weird). We were  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  for hours and hours. The  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was good,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  played all the current country  <START:A_Entertainment> songs <END>  and some older stuff too.  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  was definitely a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of people  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is great people watching. My deep fried  <START:F_FoodItem> twinkies <END>  were delicious. I think if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  were  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  a bigger  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>  that I like to frequent  <START:W_Price> more <END> , I would come back  <START:W_Price> more <END>  often.
I've been  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  a few times and enjoy the  <START:Food> food <END> , usually a packed  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  during  <START:Food> lunch <END> .
I went in  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  last night and got a  <START:F_FoodItem> quarter pounder <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and a  <START:F_Drinks> diet coke <END> .  First of all, this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is F___g filthy, I mean the worst I've ever seen  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  a McDonald's.   I'm not a clean freak by any means, and  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END> 's no way I'd let my kid play in that  <START:A_Places> playground <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  looked filthy, can you imagine how much shit  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  is that you can't see?  And I mean that literally too.  Garbage cans overflowing,  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  station with trash all over the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , dirty  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> , etc.  And to top  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  off, I could tell that my  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  had been sitting around for hours because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was almost like eating sandpaper.  I ended up throwing  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  away, and throwing  <START:Food> food <END>  away is not  <START:Food> something <END>  I do very often, that's for sure.  French  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were good and fresh though,  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  least  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END> 's that.
I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's the best! Great  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:O_Experience> experince <END>  for friends and family. If your hungry for some ny style  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  come  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> .
Love the  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , only thing is the  <START:Food> food <END>  can be a bit pricey  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  times for a  <START:Restaurant> pub <END> .
I'm a regular  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> . I usually eat in  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  with my family and the customer  <START:Service> service <END>  is great. The sitting area is awesome. The  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  and  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  are very comfortable.  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_Drinks> thai iced tea <END>  is amazing, just wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  didn't put so much  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  in  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Don't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to spict because medium is already really really hot for me I couldn't eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , unless you're obsessed with spicy  <START:Food> food <END>  go for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ! The  <START:F_Appetizer> tom kha   soup   <END>  is so good. I usually  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> tom kha coconut milk   soup   <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  fried  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and two  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pad thai <END> . I do  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> take out <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  a lot and every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I  <START:Food> get <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  within the  <START:S_Del_Time> 20   minutes   <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would be ready I never had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for my  <START:Food> food <END>  for a long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> !  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  understand and speak English very well. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  look very neat and cleanly. The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  itself is very clean with an A  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rating <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  a great  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , on Russel and Rainbow.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in the  <START:A_LocatedArea> plaza <END>  where the Starbucks is, and next to a Flower  <START:Restaurant> shop <END> .
Went  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  for a late night  <START:F_Appetizer> sushi <END>  craving and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> , <START:F_FoodItem> yellowtail <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END> ,   <START:F_Drinks> red dragon <END> , WTH,  <START:F_Drinks> cherry blossom <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> rattle snake   rolls   <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  was good,  our  <START:F_FoodItem> yellowtail <END>  slices where small and thin compared the big thick cuts of  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> .  All the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were very good,  slices could have been sliced a tad bit thinner,   all the cuts were about an inch thick.  Definitely not bit  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  pieces but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  sure didn't fall apart. The  <START:Food> food <END>  overall I would have to give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4   star   <END> .  The reason  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  got demoted to  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 3   stars   <END>  is due to the fact that the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  came out with gratuity of $17 on a  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  of $95 before tax.  I understand the need for yours automatic gratuity charge and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is usually used for parties of 6 or  <START:W_Price> more <END> ...But  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was only a party of 2!!!!
Very unsatisfied with the  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was great, but our  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and double  <START:F_FoodItem> cheeseburger <END>  were burnt - not to mention the  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were just dabbed with seasoning in the middle and not spread out, COLD TOO. I used to enjoy coming to  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  café for  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  graveyard  <START:Offers> specials <END> , but now  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seems the  <START:S_Staff> cook <END>  is different. I don't really recommend coming for a quick  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END> .
We aren't huge fans of  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , but this is one of the couple  <START:Restaurant> chains <END>  we do frequent.    <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  that brought us in and probably what keeps us coming back.    Happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  is a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to come and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  goes until 6:30 where a lot of  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  stop  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  6!   <START:Food> get <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  if you are a lover of  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> .   Other good  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  are the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  or the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> !   mmmService is hit or miss  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , but never so bad that we haven't wanted to return.
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is awesome! The  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  are reasonable (not dirt cheap but certainly fair) and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is quick. I often go to a  <START:F_FoodItem> cheesesteak <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  by my work which--despite being less busy--always take too long to  <START:Food> get <END>  my  <START:Food> food <END> !  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't  <START:Offers> offer <END>  too much other than  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheesesteaks <END>   so don't go  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  if you  <START:Food> want <END>   <START:Food> something <END>  else. Most importantly the  <START:Food> food <END>  tasted amazing! The  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were the best in my opinion so I highly recommend trying  <START:Food> them <END> !
We used to go  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  every other weekend, then about 3 weeks ago  <START:Food> something <END>  changed. What happened to  <START:S_Staff> security <END> ?  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's way too rowdy of a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for 4  <START:S_Staff> security <END>  guards, especially on the weekend! The last 2 weekends have been SCARY! Fights inside and  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  of the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , someone's going to  <START:Food> get <END>  hurt!  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's no fun watching your back the whole  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  you're supposed to be drinking...we won't be back unless  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  return to the RESPONSIBLE  <START:S_Staff> management <END> !
The  <START:Food> food <END>  was good, but WAY overpriced.  I really like the concept of no  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  with a  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  for sides and  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  that come around offering you  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .  I felt bad for the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  who had  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  since I imagine many people decline  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  in favor of the  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  and various  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:S_Menu> options <END> .  However,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was $37/ person which is definitely overpriced for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END>  considering you can  <START:Food> get <END>  a much higher  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> entree <END>  for a similar  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>   <START:Restaurant> at <END>  L'Etoile or Harvest.  I would only recommend going  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  if you are extremely hungry and you really  <START:Food> want <END>  to be able to eat  <START:S_Delivery> right <END>  away without having to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  I don't plan on returning despite the beautiful  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  and friendly  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> .
Every once in a while Pete's can kind of hit the spot... but I'm not quite as crazy about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  as some locals seems to be. The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  are good and cheap; and  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is pretty damn tasty... but I usually leave feeling a little fishy and greased out. The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  is perfectly square, and I can't help but wonder why  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  that way... because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  really gives off a 'store bought' vibe. Compare this to somewhere like Fulton  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  Fry in Vegas which has fresh pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  that each kind of form  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  own twisted and unique shape...  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  just feels  <START:W_Price> more <END>  authentic that way. This just feel like a  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> patty <END>  that could have been taken out of a McDonalds Filet-O- <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and thrown in the greaser.So what I gotta say about Pete's is this: only go if you're craving some no-frills  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> ; and if you have such a craving you'll probably leave happy... if however you are looking for  <START:Food> something <END>  to make your  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  buds shiver with excitement, then look  <START:Restaurant> elsewhere <END> . Oh yeah... one last thing...  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  whole sense of entitlement really gets on my nerves sometimes. Having kooky rules  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is fun, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  only works if that  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  up magnificent  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  you are getting average  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  try to make you feel like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are the Gods of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and you must bow down and obey  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  every command if you  <START:Food> want <END>  to  <START:Food> get <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  (like  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  whole "no  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END> -don't even ask" thing). You better be careful Pete's or you may find people are gonna find  <START:Restaurant> somewhere else <END>  with better  <START:Food> food <END> , that doesn't hassle you if you ask for  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END> . Meh.
Absolutely terrible. I would give this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 0   stars   <END>  if I could. I was with a group of 6 other people and none of us  <START:O_Experience> enjoyed <END>  our  <START:Food> meal <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  (a staple  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  any Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ) was a far cry from pretty much any other  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in the  <START:A_LocatedArea> valley <END>  (Mexican and otherwise). As for the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END> , I would put these  <START:Food> entrees <END>  (and  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END> , even) on the "expensive" side of the scale. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was acceptable, although I can only suspect the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  expects large tips from  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  hugely inflated  <START:O_Payment> bills <END> . Sadly,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  may not  <START:Food> get <END>  any return customers with the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  the way  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is.
Well, folks, based on the review by Teri C, we thought we would go over and try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .Alas,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are closed for good.  We are not locals but were just passing through so i don't know if this was a victim of the recession or what.  But, I do know  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is closed and abandoned,What a shame,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a beautiful  <START:Ambience> building <END> .Jim
I'm visiting Madison and went  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> -  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was terrific! I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> pumpkin <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's October, after all) and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was sooo tasty! Not too  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END> , perfectly filling, and reasonably  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly and the  <START:A_Places> space <END>  was really cute. I'd make this a regular morning stop if I lived  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> !
I have been wanting to go to  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  Silverado  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , but because Katrina M. has a groupon for this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  we stopped by for brunch before  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  had to work.When we entered, the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was steady but not busy. We sat down  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  just cleaned off and were greeted with  <START:S_Menu> menus <END> . Wanting to avoid any hassles we  <START:A_Entertainment> showed <END>  the  <START:Offers> coupon <END>  and got that out of the way. From that point on,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  did not feel like we were top priority, but we were not ignored completely either. Katrina M. was in the mood for  <START:F_FoodItem> waffles <END>  and turned  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  into a combo with  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  for a  <START:F_FI_Price> dollar <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> waffle <END>  was ok, a little soft for my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . I have been craving a  <START:F_FoodItem> patty <END>  melt with grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , so I jumped on that. I also chose a bowl of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tortilla  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  for my side. The  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> light <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> patty <END>  melt was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to a perfect medium rare and juicy. Maybe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a little too juicy because my rye  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was soggy. I love that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do not fry the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  in a ton of oil to make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  crispy, but the second half of my  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  had sopped up all the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:F_Drinks> juices <END>  before I could  <START:Food> get <END>  to  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was not bad, just not  <START:Food> something <END>  I would drive across town for.
Is  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  better than your average fast  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> ? Yes. Is  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  the best BBQ ever? No way! But Dickeys  <START:Food> food <END>  is decent.  <START:Food> food <END>  is cheap  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  and pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  are good,  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem>   okra  - darn <END>  good. Went in the other day because I didn't  <START:Food> want <END>  to  <START:S_Staff> cook <END> , and after watching "Super  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  Me'" about a month ago, I stay away from the obvious "fast  <START:Food> food <END> "  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  completely. So, craving some red  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  I went to Dickeys for  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> take out <END>  because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was close and I figured  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  wouldn't be as processed as McD's- seriously that movie gave me nightmares. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was super friendly, the football  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  was on TV., the  <START:Food> food <END>  was done  <START:S_Del_Time> quickly <END> - giving me enough  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to make myself a root  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  float and watch AZ lose in OT- :( For 3 of us I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cheese <END> , fried  <START:F_FoodItem> okra <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> potato casserole <END> , and 2  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . When I got home I was disappointed to see that the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  looked like processed poo on a  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . Really  <START:S_Staff> guys <END> -  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>  slimy poo on a  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> - <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was that gross! I refused to  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , and  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  else was brave enough to  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  least try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , only to decide  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  couldn't eat  <START:W_Price> more <END>  than 1  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> - but the  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  thought  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was delicious. Never tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> potato casserole <END>  because Dickeys forgot to pack  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cheese <END>  was gross! I'm not a  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  person, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  definitely needed  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> pepper <END>  to give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> macaroni <END>  was over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to that gross slimy  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  consistency. So, the 3 of us shared 4  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> okra <END> , and an individual  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END>  with 2  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> - one person was hungry enough to go ahead and eat the  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cheese <END>  even though he didn't like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Dickeys would have gotten 1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  but the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> okra <END>  were pretty darn good and I made one hell of a root  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  float while I was  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END> . I may be seen in Dickeys again because I have a fondness for fried  <START:F_FoodItem> okra <END>  and I have tried  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  before and liked  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . But I will definitely  <START:Food> check <END>  my  <START:Food> takeout <END>  before I leave to make sure  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is all  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  and I will never  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cheese <END>  or processed  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  poo again.
Amazing  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !  Stumbled by  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  one day and made  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  to go  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  the week after.  What a nice concept.  The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is also very homey and makes you feel instantly very comfortable.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  helps that the  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  don't seem to be in a rush  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  all since  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're all volunteers.  Even your tip goes to charity!! And of course the  <START:Food> food <END>  was actually amazing.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  change  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  from  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  so the same  <START:S_Menu> options <END>  are not always available but if you  <START:Food> get <END>  a chance to try  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  lentil dahl, do  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was hands down the most flavourful and spiced- <START:F_FoodItem> infused dahl <END>  I've ever tasted.  Mmm my mouth is  <START:F_Drinks> watering <END>  just thinking about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .After that, I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  which was pretty good. The presentation was very nice.Another compliment to the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> !  So crunchy on the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  but soft on the inside - the way  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  is supposed to be.  I went with some Bretons (who apparently are  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  experts, or so  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  claim) and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  confirmed that  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was, indeed,  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  of excellent  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  We asked  <START:Food> them <END>  to refill the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  about 3 times and  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the end, our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was so  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  and gave us a doggy-bag for the remainder in our basket.Robin des Bois made both my stomach and heart happy.
Found this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  through Yelp and was not disappointed. Had the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  platter and  <START:Food> everything <END>  was excellent.  In my short trip in Montreal I tried 2 other fast  <START:Food> food <END>  Lebanese  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  and this one was definitely the best.  (Comes with  <START:F_FoodItem> hummus <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pickled <END> /shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END> , other  <START:F_FoodItem> pickled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , and a piece of  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END> )  The best part of the entire  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was conversing with Mr. Boustan about Montreal and hearing him drop knowledge on some McGill students about the merits of keeping up with class in the short term so  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  can go out/party/relax on the night before the exam.  Apparently he did this when he was in engineering school.
Did not see any single person walking around passing out passes to go to Lavo. Walked in to grab the  <START:Offers> free admission pass <END>  during  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , called in the afternoon to be put on the guestlist without any promoter's name, and  <START:A_Entertainment> showed <END>  up  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  night and got in less than 3 minute  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  thru guestlist  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> . <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  is 1 particular free adimssion Pass that also gives you a free  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  ticket. You have to look for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  though..because  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END> 's like 4 different version of free admission passes and  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END> 's only ONE that gives u a free  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . Lavo was very generous with  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  comp  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  rule -  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  was none! You could have  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had on hand. Most other  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  have that stupid rule that only well  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  apply to comp  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  =P So take advantage of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with your pass...The  <START:A_Places> club <END>  itself was a lot smaller than I thought, but I still liked the feel. Pretty chill, nice  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , the nicest  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  - (yes...much friendlier than the ones  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  Blush in the Wynn who were snobs and even nicer than XS  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END> ) who won't hesitate to help you out with  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Menu> options <END> .The  <START:A_Entertainment> dance <END>   <START:A_Places> floor <END>  IS quite small..but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  works.And finally,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have the most awesome  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END>  ever..I absolutely LOVED  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .. <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  reminded me of some enchanted castle restroom or  <START:Food> something <END> , with  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  lion-head sinks..hahaAll in all, XS is better..but Lavo is a great alternative to the others (better than Pure, the Bank, etc)
This is one of those few Indian restaraunts that never seams to fail in all aspects.  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  is flawlessly perfect, the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  is great,  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  is prompt and  <START:Food> everything <END>  looks clean and fresh. I HIGHLY recomend going for  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  Sunday Brunch.
Very disappointed in this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Got a  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> take out <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and when got  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  home.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was disgusting. Only got the Hibachi  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END>  with side of  <START:F_FoodItem> zucchini <END> . When  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  my husband told  <START:Food> them <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> zucchini <END>  only no  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> . Well basically thats all  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was and i am highly allergic to  <START:F_Ingredients> onions <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  were maybe 5 to 6 very very small pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  that had been very overcooked. Couldn't even chew  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Needless to say i was very upset called and talked to  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  his only comment. When you come back in next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  i will give you some  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . What the heck. Like that's going to happen.
Hands down best  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in Vegas!! The  <START:Food> food <END>  was absolutely delicious and  <START:Food> everything <END>  I wanted. My favorite were the  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END> . The customer  <START:Service> service <END>  was outstanding!! The  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  were so welcoming and friendly. Will be returning again tomorrow and everytime I come  <START:Restaurant> visit <END>  Vegas.
Make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> , the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  can  <START:Food> get <END>  pretty long. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are delicious! I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> corned <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  on rye and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was soooooo huge and sooooo  <START:W_Price> worth <END> . Try the  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END>  sangrias!  <START:Food> get <END>  a  <START:Food> pitcher <END> ! To yourself! lol but seriously,  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sangria <END>  are very  <START:F_FI_Quality> light <END> , very  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END> . and ofcourse, the frozen hot  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  is a must try.
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was great. The  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  are amazing, the  <START:Service> service <END>  is friendly, and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is delicious. This is not  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  bell or Margaritaville. Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  and New Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  are two different  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not suppose to have tons of  <START:F_Ingredients> spices <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> salts <END>  like Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  does.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's the  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastiness <END>  of the fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  and the hot  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  that makes this  <START:Food> food <END>  amazing. The reviews that said the  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> bland <END> , are just use to dousing  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  in  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> .My fiance is from New Mexico so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a relief to find a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  where you can  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> take home <END>  frozen  <START:F_Ingredients> green chilies <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tortillas <END> . We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  our 4 dozen  <START:F_FoodItem> tamales <END>  for Christmas. <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  needs to give this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  a shot. We will be going  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>   <START:Restaurant> at <END>  least twice a week from now on.
Very  <START:Food> food <END>  falafal and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pitas <END>  were fresh. The Baba Ghannouj was particularly delicious! The roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> eggplant <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  really carried through.
Went  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  for a birthday celebration, and I have to say I was impressed! The party was on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  upstairs, and while the weather was unusually chilly and windy for a spring evening, the heat lamps and the rocking  <START:A_Places> fireplace <END>  kept me warm. We started off the evening  <START:S_Delivery> right <END>  with an array of  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , including  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ceviche <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  fingers w/ a side of  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> calamari <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ceviche <END> - Large pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  tossed with fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapenos <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cilantro <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END>  and red  <START:F_Ingredients> onions <END>  marinated in fresh squeezed  <START:F_Ingredients> lime <END>  juice.  <START:Service> served <END>  with homemade  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and warm tortilla  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> . A little difficult to eat, but refreshing &  <START:F_FI_Quality> light <END>  nonetheless.  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  fingers- Large pieces of juicy white  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> breaded <END>  & fried to ultra crispy perfection. The  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were awesome as well, crunchy on the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  & fluffy in the inside...so bad for you, but so yummy. <START:F_FoodItem> calamari <END> - Freshly  <START:F_FoodItem> breaded <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> calamari <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  with house Cajun remoulade and  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . My least favorite  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  of the night. I wish the  <START:F_FoodItem> calamari <END>  was  <START:W_Price> more <END>  crunchy & less oily.  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> - Homemade tortilla  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  topped with  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , Jack and Cheddar  <START:F_Ingredients> cheese <END> , fresh pico de gallo,  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapenos <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> sour cream <END> .  <START:Service> served <END>  with freshly made  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> . The  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  is ginormous, enough to feed a whole family and then some (I kid you not!).  To wash all this  <START:Food> food <END>  down, I  <START:F_Drinks> drank <END>  an AMF (Adios...), which was strong and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END> . By this point, I was stuffed beyond belief & ready to pass out, but the DJ started playing  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  to which I had to  <START:Food> get <END>  up &  <START:A_Entertainment> dance <END>  to to burn some of the millions of calories I had just  <START:S_Delivery> consumed <END> . Some of the  <START:A_Entertainment> songs <END>  were good, while the other  <START:A_Entertainment> songs <END>  made me wonder, but in the end, my friends & I had a fantastic night. The  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were good, the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were awesome and on point, and the DJ that came later on in the night played some  <START:A_Env_Type> cool <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> dance <END>  jams. Needless to say, I had a great  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  and can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to come back to play a couple rounds of skee ball  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> arcade <END> !
Very disappointing  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .  We went for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  on a Sunday evening and arrived  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  around 5:15 PM.  We had been looking forward to  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  some pho but were informed that about 70% of the  <START:Food> items <END>  listed on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  were not available (including any pho).  The  <START:Food> dishes <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  very ok but not good enough to leave a lasting impression.  In addition, the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  did not accept our  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .com gift certificate and also does not accept  <START:O_Pay_Method> credit cards <END> .   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to look for another Vietnamese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with better  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END> .
My jaw dropped as I walked into this amazing store! This store holds products that not every generic supermarket has. I felt as though  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a combination of Vons, 99  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END>  Market and Cardenas all rolled into one amazing store!  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>  and culinary students (like myself) could find  <START:Food> anything <END>  you need to make an exquisite  <START:Food> meal <END> !
Modern  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  in Scottsdale is  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  7014 East Camelback Road, but you'll know  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  better as Scottsdale Fashion Square (aka: BMW's overflow lot). Modern  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  is part of Fox  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Concepts, who are known for some highly acclaimed eateries: Bloom, Olive & Ivy, North, The Greene House, et al. I'm usually not a corporate  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Staff> guy <END> , but Fox RC knows what the hell  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are doing, so I was all on board with giving Modern  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  a try. <START:Food> dinner <END>  The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is big and very bold. Lots of  <START:A_Decor> blue/silver <END> , accented with  <START:A_Decor> whites <END>  and  <START:A_Decor> browns <END> . The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is very busy, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  works. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area is a nice  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  with just enough flat panels to satisfy your curiosity on the  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END> , without spoiling the aesthetic of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  in the main dining area is varied:  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> , long  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  bench  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END> , corner  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END> , and some smaller  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  that mimic eating  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  (but you're really in the  <START:A_LocatedArea> mall <END> ). Personally, I'd take a pass on having people watch me eat as  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  walk back from donating a kidney in exchange for some new duds  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  Barney's. The  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list is fairly small for a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  of this caliber with maybe 30  <START:F_Drinks> wines <END>  total, but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are almost all available by the  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END> . Most of the bottles range from about 2x - 3x retail  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> .  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  idea of a "reserve list" consists of two  <START:F_Drinks> wines <END>  that are both $35 a  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are both very good  <START:F_Drinks> wines <END> , but then again,  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  $35 a  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  should be. I settled on a  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  of Kunde Syrah that was $10.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  forward syrah from the CA Central Coast that has nicely rounded tannins and a smooth, smoky finish. Those of you thinking the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is all about red  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  will be in for a surprise as  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  are a lot of  <START:Food> seafood <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  available. But lovers of the cow won't be upset as Modern  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  does live up to its name with about a dozen  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> entrees <END> . Unsurprisingly, the  <START:Food> entrees <END>  mostly come without any sides, so any  <START:Food> extras <END>  you  <START:Food> want <END>  will be a la carte. I spied  <START:F_FoodItem> parmesan <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  amongst the sides and knew immediately  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would be part of the  <START:Food> meal <END> .  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  is what we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> :Poached Wild Caught  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  - This was simply amazing! Four colossal  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly then chilled.  <START:Service> served <END>  with a  <START:F_Ingredients> ginger <END>  infused  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and some small  <START:F_Ingredients> herbs <END>  (maybe micro arugula?).  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a perfect start to the  <START:Food> meal <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Short  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  with Red  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  Jus and  <START:F_FoodItem> horseradish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> gnocchi <END>  - This was a very well executed  <START:Food> dish <END> . The short  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  was very tender and just melted in your mouth. The  <START:F_FoodItem> gnocchi <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  had just enough  <START:F_FoodItem> horseradish <END>  without overpowering the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . The jus was a perfect accent to the  <START:Food> dish <END>  and mixed well with the  <START:F_FoodItem> horseradish <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also split the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  onto two  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  for us without being asked (always a plus).  <START:F_FoodItem> parmesan <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  - These kind of speak for themselves. Thin cut  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  married with  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>  oil and  <START:F_FoodItem> parmesan <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> cheese <END> . Perfectly crispy and just a delight to pop in your mouth.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  come with "house made  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END> ". When I heard that, all I could think of was Chevy Chase in Vacation: "Ooooh, real tomato  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END> , Eddie???"  This  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END>  was much better than that, but still seemed lacking. We ended up getting a side of the homemade  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END>  dressing to dip  <START:Food> them <END>  in instead. Nothing but high class  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ....Sauteed  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> parmesan <END>  - We were lacking greenery  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , so we also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a side of the  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  OK, but seemed a little  <START:F_FI_Quality> bland <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also cut the spears into 2 inch pieces, which doesn't hurt the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  looked odd. All in all, a pretty forgettable side  <START:Food> dish <END> . Final TakeModern  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  continues the trend of a high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  run by Fox RC. The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  are solid and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is very good. The  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is great, so  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  will probably keep themselves pretty busy between the  <START:A_LocatedArea> mall <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  and people walking over  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  Town. I will be back because I  <START:Food> want <END>  to try  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  (you can  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  in the  <START:Restaurant> restuarant <END>  or from a "to go"  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>  that you access from inside the  <START:A_LocatedArea> mall <END> ). The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:S_Menu> options <END>  are not cheap, but I feel you  <START:Food> get <END>  a  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  for the  <START:W_Price> money <END> . Overall Grade = B+ (Very Good)The EV Foodie
I ended up trying this Five  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  again due to a large family outing and I was pleasantly surprised by the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  being good!!  All eight people agreed the  <START:Food> food <END>  was good!
We love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's difficult to be unbiased about my review. First,  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END> 's no illusion  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> , this is, as the red necks say, a  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  camp, so don't be surprised when your flatware arrives in a plastic bag. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has its share of deeply fried  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  fare and your side  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  include the also fried, french  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> hush puppies <END> . However, once you make your way past the fried with fried  <START:Food> dishes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  is a great broiled section, that offers a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and  <START:Food> shellfish <END>  broiled to perfection with some nice seasoning. Although your  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  of non-fried sides is limited, you can find a moderately  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> . I always  <START:Food> get <END>  the broiled  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and although one of the  <START:W_Price> more <END>  expensive  <START:Food> items <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is delicious, filling, and not "break the bank" expensive. But before you  <START:Food> get <END>  too full, remember to leave  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for the Crazy  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> ! you cannot leave without picking up a slice, even if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is to  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> take home <END> . We are talking about a  <START:F_Ingredients> rainbow sprinkle <END>  topped  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  made up of individual layers of  <START:Food> chocolate <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> red velvet <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> carrot <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>  jam topped  <START:F_Ingredients> vanilla <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  - that's  <START:S_Delivery> right <END>  4 layers, each with  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  complementary frostings holiding  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  together. The kitsch of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:Ambience> everywhere <END> , from the porthole shaped  <START:A_Furniture> windows <END> , to the nets and seashells hanging up on the dining  <START:A_Places> floor <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waitstaff <END>  is always friendly, your  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  is always full and the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  just has a sort of feel good  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  that is difficult to explain.
Went  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  twice and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ,  <START:Food> something <END>  I never  <START:Food> get <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was truly exceptional and decent  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END> . I ate the second half the next day. The crock of  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END>  and the  <START:F_Ingredients> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cracker <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  are well done. I can't say  <START:Food> anything <END>  for the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:S_Menu> choices <END> , as I only had a moscato. I suspect the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  hope to make  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  profit on the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , since the  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  was notably small. Yes, I know a sparkling  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  perhaps should be  <START:Service> served <END>  in a flute. A solid and affordable  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  seems to have a lot of anxious young men working the  <START:A_Places> floor <END> , but we got a warm and engaging foodie  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  should  <START:Food> get <END>  a raise for improving the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> .
My favorite ramen spot  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  in Vegas.  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  slow roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  is the best. Nice  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> . Great  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END>   <START:Food> food <END> . Filling. Easy on the wallet.
Best BBQ ever! We love the  <START:Food> food <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , and did I mention the  <START:Food> food <END> . We have had to cut back from having  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  every weekend because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was helping is gain some unwanted weight LOL but  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  we introduce to  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  on a Fork loves  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and becomes a loyal follower as well.
What a delicious surprise  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the Mesa Arts Festival!  I have been dreaming of a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to  <START:Food> get <END>  a  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  with interesting and mouth  <START:F_Drinks> watering <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  for as long  as I can remember!  I was a little surprised when I was handed my  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wrapped <END>  in  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was better than a  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END> . I will be tracking this one down again and again!
Fancy  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  - good  <START:Food> food <END>  & good  <START:Service> service <END> 
love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !! i work just down the street so atleast two times a week i meet the wife and kids for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  is a nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  area for the kiddos, Great  <START:Food> food <END>  and  great  <START:Service> service <END> !! Landon is the man!!!
I'd give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a 3. <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 5   stars   <END>  if i could. <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a good  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END> , but i don't really feel like i have to go back.
I really wanted to like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , I love  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  working (the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ?) was great - friendly, enthusiastic and seemed to really  <START:Food> want <END>  to bring the new England  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  to Vegas. I thought the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  itself was ok -  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  blasting  <START:A_Env_AC> ac <END>  was a nice escape from the summer heat.  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  were really padded and super comfy. I thought  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was cute that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  condiment bottles in  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  6pack carriers. I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  for $7.99 I didn't expect too much for the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't the best, but wasn't bad. The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was good - perfectly  <START:F_Ingredients> buttered <END>  and toasted, he said  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  just started shipping the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  in from I think maine? So like I said,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do care and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are trying. I love that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had crinkle  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> , I'm sick of this whole shoestring  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  thing so many  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  have going on. Crinkle  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  remind me of elementary school  <START:Food> lunch <END>  - the  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  of every craptastic  <START:Food> meal <END> . Also had the fried  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  $7 or $ <START:F_FI_Price> 8 <END>  I can't remember.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were pretty good - a decent  <START:A_Places> portion <END> , hand  <START:F_FoodItem> breaded <END>  w panko.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  may need to change  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  oil because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had a weird after- <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  oil. I'm honestly not sure that I'll be back.  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 've been open long enough to work out the kinks, but the reviews are mostly the same - ok but not great when this is a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  specializing in  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> .
The  <START:Service> service <END>  is good  <START:Restaurant> at <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is good  <START:Restaurant> at <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is amazing! So many  <START:S_Menu> options <END>  to make a pie even if you're watching your diet. We go 2 or 3 Tuesdays a month and always try to sit  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>   <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . The  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  is great! Another  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I'd highly suggest!
Love this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> !  Best Thai in Charlotte. We go weekly and are never disappointed.  Pad Kaprow and Pad Prik are among my favorites.  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is excellent.
I had a serious fight with my gf and after we had  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> she <END> 's totally happy now ;) we were told  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  was  <START:S_Del_Time> 45-min <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> ,    But we were called in less than  <START:S_Del_Time> 30 min <END> . Super friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ,  <START:Food> food <END>  was fresh and authentic. Compared to the other AYCE  <START:F_Appetizer> sushi <END>  this one is definitely the best. We tried all the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  and all were fantastic! Not too  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END> . uni was fresh.favorite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Vegas!!
i  <START:Restaurant> visit <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  over the weekend to give  <START:Food> them <END>  a second chance since last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Staff> server <END>  is lack of training and very bad attitude not precise with  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and still the same even worse this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> !!!
Finally  <START:Restaurant> somewhere else <END>  for  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  around the downtown area to eat besides the court  <START:Restaurant> cafeteria <END> !! Pretty good  <START:Food> food <END> , but the  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  are a tad expensive ($10 for  <START:F_FoodItem> pad thai <END> , Drunken Noodles, or Pad-See-Ew) but I can understand because of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>   <START:S_Delivery> right <END>  across from Insert Coins.  However, I do like the  <START:Food> food <END>  though;  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's well made with just the  <START:S_Delivery> right <END>   <START:O_Pay_Price> amount <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  (fyi the  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  level is from 1-5 with 2 being medium). If you are going for  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> take out <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  usually takes about 20- <START:S_Del_Time> 30 min <END> . to prepare  <START:Food> food <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in my opinion. Highly recommend  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  Pad-See-Ew and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  Drunken Noodles ($2 extra for  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ). Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> !!
The  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  covered  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  did not have fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had preserves. I wish  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  had said that  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>  preserve.
Neither my hubby or I liked this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Our  <START:Food> food <END>  was not tasty- we were thinking, "jeez-I'm  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  someone to  <START:S_Staff> cook <END>  this??" And although my hub liked his  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , I didn'tike mine. We'll go  <START:Restaurant> elsewhere <END> .
 <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  Works has become my go-to  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  when I don't wish to stray far from my  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END> . The  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  is reminiscent of a greasy spoon with dark and uninspiring  <START:F_FI_Quality> bland <END>   <START:A_Decor> colors <END> . The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  doesn't do much to perk one's  <START:F_Appetizer> appetite <END>  and mood during  <START:Food> breakfast <END> . On the condiment tray,  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END> 's a smiley  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  and a frowny  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  graphic that indicates whether or not you require  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:Service> service <END> . A.k.a,  <START:Food> get <END>   <START:S_Staff> their <END>  attention. The  <START:Service> service <END>  can be friendly or you can also end up with a snooty  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  that tells you  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't do the frowning  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  anymore. Well, why do you put  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  then?Can't give an opinion on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  but  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelettes <END>  are pretty good. Overall, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is decent and the banana  <START:F_FoodItem> muffin <END>  that comes with some  <START:Food> meals <END>  will be bringing you back.
Honestly, I've had better. Way better. Ellis Island is off the strip and can be difficult to  <START:Food> get <END>  a taxi back from, the  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  is your typical sticky wooden  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> , and the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  is usually overcooked and by no means great  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .But for some reason, every Vegas trip of mine has to include a drunken trip  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>   <START:Restaurant> at <END>  4 am for $5.99  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> . Sometimes 2 in 1 night for those friends of mine that are so drunk  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  forgot  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  went the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  around. And for the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> , your drunk self will be happy eating the home style  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and soaking up the runny  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> yolk <END>  with some  <START:F_Ingredients> buttered <END>  toast. I sure am every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
My first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  trying this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a toss up between  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and a  <START:Restaurant> subway <END>  with one  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  ratings.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't a very difficult decision.  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  was another  <START:F_Drinks> patron <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  when I entered. I took a look  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and knew I'd be coming  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  on a daily basis.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a toasted Italian  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  which I'm eating now.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's delicious!
My husband and I travelled from York, SC to meet friends for a concert Uptown on Thursday evening. One of the couples we were joining made a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  for six  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the Roosters Uptown  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .In the spirit of full disclosure, four of us arrived 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  late to join the third couple  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  our reserved  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . We entered the Bank of America complex on the wrong side and took a scenic tour of several catwalks, escalator banks and retail corridors in our quest to find the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> !  We were definitely late, and we accept responsibility for that.However, a note to Rooster's:(1) If you  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  us, you are implying that  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is within your professional capacity to  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  us in a timely manner. (2) If  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is apparent that you are in the midst of a rush you were inadequately prepared to handle, please alert the  <START:F_Drinks> patrons <END>  arriving 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  late to  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  that  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is in  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  best interest to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>   <START:Restaurant> elsewhere <END> .(3) If your  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  is so far in the weeds to be unable, in retrospect, to take  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  within the first 1/2  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  of the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  (let alone  <START:Food> entree <END>   <START:Food> selections <END> ), simply be apologetic and bring our checks when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are requested. Snarky, rude  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  reflect very poorly on the managerial  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  of any  <START:Ambience> establishment <END> .As far as the actual dining  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  and the tiny sampling of the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  we accomplished:(1) The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is fantastic. In an area surrounded by modern, sleek and minimalist designs, Roosters manages to carve out a tiny niche reminiscent of a converted farmhouse, complete with lowered  <START:Ambience> ceilings <END> , weathered wood  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and beautiful iron chandeliers. The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  felt intimate and casual but with an elegant touch.(2) The Skinny Margarita Martini was perfect. Fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> lime <END>  pulp added just enough tartness....full  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cold, and delicious.(3) The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  was fairly good and was  <START:Service> served <END>  very cold. The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  offered an excellent suggestion to my husband when his first  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  was not available.(4) The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  is hardy, with a nutty  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  - paired with the dipping oil  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a wonderful start to what could have been a rich and tasty  <START:Food> dinner <END> .(5) Only negative; the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  was strangely metallic and, well...yucky.
A little pricey? Sure. But the  <START:Food> food <END>  is delicious, and the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is quite unique. The Szechuan  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  belly was a great starting  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> , the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list was  <START:W_Price> more <END>  impressive than I was expecting, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> polenta <END>  was perfectly tender and delicious - despite the understandable skepticism about smoked and then roasted. And because I'm a huge sucker who can't say 'no' to a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> , I packed the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  torte in every available remaining cranny. Painfully stuffed, but unbelievably satisfied, I almost forgot that I had work to do the next day.Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm in town, this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  will definitely be on my short list.
I really did like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and would go back  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  if in the  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END> . <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do have some growing pains to work out. 1.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do need to remodel. I believe from what I saw  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are working on that. I don't go to a  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  for  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  anyways so I didn't have any major issue with this. If you like a  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  with  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  Las Vegas is about 5 hours away.2.  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  is good, I liked the grape leaves,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  schwarma, and I  <START:O_Experience> enjoyed <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> hummus <END>  and fresh made  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . Thoughts, have a  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  Station that someone can work, instead of the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  running around trying to do  <START:Food> everything <END>  (To the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> , you were fantastic, I wanted to give you a hug when I left!).  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  are some tweaks that need to happen to some of the  <START:Food> food <END> , mostly the American like the  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  Alfredo,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  nuggets etc. I would love  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would give my  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  friend a job he could turn the OK to fabulous as he is amazing with Eastern  <START:Food> food <END> , and American  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  that. <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  appears to be a family run  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , Husband, Wife and Two Daughters. I will tell you this,  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  two girls are some of the most respectful well mannered girls I have ever met.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were amazingly attentive.If the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  read your reviews, and from the  <START:Service> service <END>  I am pretty sure you do, because I saw major changes from some of the reviews, you have a great thing going for you. Focus on the American  <START:Food> food <END>  making  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  better, or even better then that taking that out and adding  <START:W_Price> more <END>  Mediterranean  <START:Food> food <END>  (or Thai even...curries are awesome and relatively easy to make and unlike some people I am OK with that kind of  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> .)I will be back, and look forward to watching you blossom in the  <START:A_LocatedArea> valley <END> !
Man, I love a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . Nothing makes me as happy as a delicious, cheesy  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , perfect  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> , and an  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cold  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's seriously the best way to raise my spirits. The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  are pretty good.  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  well, the  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  are good, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're pretty big. The regular  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  is way too big for me, so I try to stay away from  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The  <START:A_Env_Type> cool <END>   <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  machine that allows for a million  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  combinations is pretty  <START:A_Env_Type> cool <END> , though I always end up with Sprite and peach  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . IDK. In short, I like the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> . So why three  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> ? This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is expensive for what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a little  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  joint, NBD,  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  close to an In N Out and Smashburger. Both  <START:Restaurant> places <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  for better  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> . I went to Five  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  a few days ago and spent $24 on two  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  and two  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> . Seriously. I coulda gone to Applebee's and done  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  2-for-$20 deal I love so much. The  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  are too expensive for what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is.
We were  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  last night. Very  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END>  but scored a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good but the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  we had was miserable. We asked  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  to not bring the  <START:Food> meal <END>  til we had finished  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> . Of course that request was ignored and the  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> showed <END>  up shortly after  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> .  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  then brought the  <START:Food> check <END>  before asking if we wanted  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  or  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . I like the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but after last night we will rethink going  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END> .
Went  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  for our wedding anniversary and LOVED  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  first when we pulled into the strip  <START:A_LocatedArea> mall <END> , I thought, "Hm..." but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was really wonderful. The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is charming and very well thought out. The design features an open  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> , which we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  near, but we never had a problem with too much noise. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  welcomed us with a "Happy Anniversary" and was exceptionally attentive. The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END> , who's from Chicago, stopped by the  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  and talked with us for several  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  (I had the Scottish  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> ; my husband, the  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END> ) was delicious.  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 've only been open about seven months but were decently busy for a Monday night.The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is not large but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  IS varied -  <START:Food> everything <END>  from Buffalo Sirloin to rack of  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END> , etc. And the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list is similarly not broad but excellent. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  said that on Friday and Saturday nights  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's best to make a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END> ; we had one for Monday but probably didn't need  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Highly recommend and if we lived in Phoenix we'd definitely go back often. As  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is, we're in Georgia and will have to rely on our AZ friends to help keep Rusconi's open.  <START:Food> check <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out - you won't be disappointed!
Swordfish  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  were delish! With a very cold Mic Ultra.
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great.  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  delivery from  <START:Food> them <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fast, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was still hot and gooey  <START:F_Ingredients> cheese <END> . The delivery  <START:S_Staff> guy <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> kirk <END>  I think, was very professional and was a speedy  <START:S_Staff> driver <END> . He called when he was  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> , cause he  <START:S_Delivery> delivered <END>  to the ballys  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END> . Super nice  <START:S_Staff> guy <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  shoes what kind of  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have based on the people that midtown hires.  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 5   stars   <END>  for yummy  <START:Food> food <END>  and great  <START:Service> service <END> .
I really like what The Huxley have done to this  <START:A_Places> space <END> , and especially on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menus <END> : both  <START:Food> food <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END> . Previously the Rutland  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , which had been around for a fair while, a makeover and change of name can do the world of good. I always liked the Rutland, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  felt very much like a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to have meetings in, or a subdued  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . The Huxley has a great vibe midweek. I've yet to  <START:Restaurant> visit <END>   <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the weekend. But yknow what? As far as a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  for a mid-week after-work  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> munchies <END>  goes,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's pretty good. I've heard amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> things <END>  about  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  and hot  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END> . I will be back to try these (the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  come with two patties per  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END> ?!)When I came, I tried a Grapefruit Mojito and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was really fresh and delicious. When a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  isn't specifically a ' <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ' I can be very suspicious. So many times a  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  can come unmuddled, or with chunky  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  instead of crushed, and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  can just  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like watery,  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  with a sprinkling of  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> . Not  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  The Huxley. I happened to meet the mixologist  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , who was very proud of all his creations (he has made all the recipes) and was really keen to make some  <START:F_Drinks> cocktails <END>  for me. I love this kind of energy and passion.  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  were some delicious looking numbers  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  too.The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is also really unusual, inspired and different. Hot  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END>  are, well, so hot  <START:S_Delivery> right <END>  now. But  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  were also nibbles like Poached Duck  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  with black  <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chorizo <END> . Or a Scotch Dug  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  with HP  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Or Mini Chipolatas with dip, which I had. And the Battered Sole, with a side of seaweed  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .Note: do not put half the seaweed  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  in your mouth  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  once.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like the sea. Like the sea and  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> . I used to have a through-and-through phobia of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was not pleasant. I am assured, however, that a little nibble of the  <START:Food> seafood <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  is quite pleasant.The Huxley is a new  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , and new  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>  take a while to settle into themselves. I hope  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  goes from strength to strength, however, as you can see  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 've put a lot of thought into the new  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , and the new  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> .Now, when can I go back for a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ?
Bob's is a great little  <START:Food> diner <END> , with four  <START:A_LocatedArea> locations <END>  in the Pittsburgh area. We ate  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the McKee's Rocks  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  on our last  <START:Restaurant> visit <END>  to Pittsburgh. Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by a  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  of all the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> goodies <END>  being  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  on the flat top. One thing to remember  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> : the  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are very big. My wife and I split a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  made with fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> , very spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> peppers <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> cheese <END>  etc. My only complaint would be the  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were definitely not needed. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was Dawn, who I also think was the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> .  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was very friendly and attentive.
 <START:Offers> save <END>  your  <START:W_Price> money <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  greens were  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  with some rotten leaves.  My friend got the baby Caesar and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was made with iceberg  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  and tasteless dressing.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> marinara sause <END>  was salty.  Meatballs were tiny tiny which was fine because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were not  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the calories.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was less than tasty.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was very good.  I was hoping this would be a good  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  to frequent but I'll have to keep looking.  Sorry  <START:S_Staff> guys <END> , you failed to  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END> .
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is fantastic! I've been  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  a few times for business  <START:Food> lunches <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  has always been happy. The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  are ample for one person or could be split if you also got a saled (which is huge).  <START:Food> everything <END>  looks and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  fresh and I love that you can ask to have as much as you  <START:Food> want <END>  piled on and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's still the same  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> . Although the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  can back up  <START:Restaurant> at <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  (much like a  <START:F_FoodItem> chipotle <END> ) since  <START:Food> everything <END>  is made to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is done in 3  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  after being  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  in a hig-powered 550 degree oven. I don't think I've even had a problme finding any  <START:S_Seating> seatign <END>  even when the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  is long. I actually think this  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is better than 90% of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  I've had  <START:Restaurant> elsewhere <END> . To me,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:Worthiness> worthy <END>  of  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 5 starts <END> . I just wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had one  <START:S_Delivery> right <END>  where I live.
I can't  <START:Food> get <END>  enough of this Japanese fushion  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , Soho!! :))  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  are fresh, delicious, &  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  all comes with a nice clean presentation. We recently tried a few new  <START:Food> dishes <END> . If you're open-minded try the following: blue fin  <START:F_FoodItem> toro <END> --OMG & fresh uni (eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  without dipping  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:Food> anything <END> ). In a nutshell, you must must come!! :))
Just wanted to thank the wonderful  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  Al and the very accommodating  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  for a  <START:Food> dinner <END>  to remember.   I've lived  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  in Phoenix for about six years now and love the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> at <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> oreganos <END> .  My mother passed away last year and I have two aunts that came to  <START:Restaurant> visit <END>  to celebrate  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  life on the 1 year anniversary of  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  passing, with my sister and I .    <START:S_Staff> she <END>  loved  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and we thought we would go to someplace nice to eat with great  <START:Food> food <END> .    <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was very busy that eve. We pre  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  our deep  <START:Food> dish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  within the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ,  and got our  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> quickly <END>  after sitting down.  To my disappointment  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was not the bubbly hot  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  I  <START:O_Experience> enjoyed <END>   <START:Restaurant> at <END>  previous visits.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was just kind of warm.  I let the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  know and the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  Al came to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and asked if we would like a new  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   on the house.  Another  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  wow! We mentioned the reason we were  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  that evening and I guess  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  touched his soul.  He added a fantastic cookie  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream  for our celebration of my mothers life  and picked up the whole tab on the house.  I have never been  <START:Service> treated <END>  so  <START:Offers> special <END>  on such a memorable day Al you made this  <START:Restaurant> visit <END>  from family a beautiful and wonderful memory just like my beautiful and wonderful mother .  Thank you for your thoughtfulness and compassion on such a difficult day . Wendy O
Distill is exactly what Summerlin has been waiting for.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  area really hasn't had a local  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  scene (aside from those in the neighboring  <START:A_Entertainment> casinos <END> ) before and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  really adds convenience and ease when grabbing  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  with friends after work.   <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is pretty impressive.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a step up from your average  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and has a very diverse  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  (plus  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  lovers rejoice,  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  is available all day!)  My personal favorite  <START:Food> item <END>  is the avocado  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is pretty friendly.  Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was relatively new so  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was still getting into the swing of  <START:F_FoodItem> things <END> , but you could tell  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was trying so I won't judge too critically. The  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>   <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is warm and inviting, and the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:A_Decor> layout <END>  is kind of fun.   The  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathrooms <END> , however, could use an update. Overall, I  <START:O_Experience> enjoyed <END>  Distill, will be returning and would recommend to others.
Finally a Vig in my  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END> . We have  <START:O_Experience> enjoyed <END>  the Vig Uptown for years, now  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  great  <START:Food> food <END>  is on McCormick  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END> . We loved  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  eye for detail with the design of this new  <START:Ambience> building <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:Offers> offer <END>  a large  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>   <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  plus casual  <START:Ambience> elegance <END>  inside. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is consistently good, from well prepared  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , to elegant  <START:Food> entrees <END> . The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was always busy with both the  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  to  <START:Food> diners <END>  eating  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . The noise level in the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  side can be LOUD!, especially with all the hard surfaces.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  could use some sound deading, and, not great for intimate conversations. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is the  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  prepared fresh and as  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . Note to the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> , On last  <START:Restaurant> visit <END>   <START:S_Staff> their <END>  regular  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were way too salty with  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  blend.  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are excellent.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:Offers> offer <END>  a full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  with a large  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END> . And, remember half- <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wines <END>  on Sundays.  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  is plenty of  <START:S_Parking> parking <END> .
Came  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and was unimpressed. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  brought us  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  as soon as we sat down and then was gone for like 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> . No  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . I did not try any  <START:F_Appetizer> sushi <END> , so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  could be spectacular for all I know. I had the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:A_Places> portion <END>  of Teriyaki  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> , which was a good  <START:A_Places> portion <END> , but the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was really tough. I did like the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , though.We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> gyoza <END> , which I liked, but the dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was off. My bf  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Tempura  <START:Food> lunch <END> , which was a good  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  but again, the dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was off. Probably would not rush back  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END> , but I am always willing to try  <START:Food> something <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END>  than once, because you never know!
 <START:Food> food <END> : Decent, but not great.  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  are huge and come in  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  no human could possibly eat. The  <START:F_FoodItem> waffles <END>  and other  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  are regularly portioned. <START:Service> service <END> : Good. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very nice, but  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  efforts to sell us the most expensive  <START:S_Menu> options <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  were not subtle  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  all. <START:O_Pay_Price> pricing <END> : Overpriced, but what can you expect when you come to Las Vegas?  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> waffles <END>  range from $9.95 to $13.95.The café is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  inside the SLS, so make sure to  <START:A_Places> park <END>  in  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  structure. The  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  are pretty good, but make sure you share with  <START:Food> them <END>  with someone, as you typically  <START:Food> get <END>  three  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  (each larger than the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're  <START:Service> served <END>  on). The  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  comes in a French press, which makes a very nice  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> . However, be aware that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  charge per physical  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  that you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , even if you only have one French press.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  didn't disclose this  <START:Restaurant> at <END>  any point until we got the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> , which was kind of shady.This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was good, but definitely nothing to rave about. Surely  <START:F_FoodItem> there <END>  are other, better  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  to eat in Las Vegas.
Stopped in  <START:A_LocatedArea> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  bc  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:S_Delivery> right <END>  around the corner from my work and I was really looking forward to  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very nice. I asked what the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  consisted of bc I don't like deep fried/heavy  <START:F_FoodItem> things <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . Turns out  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just seasoned  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  so that's what I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  itself was good, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  wasn't seasoned evenly. The first couple  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  I could  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  some of the seasoning and after that  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was really  <START:F_FI_Quality> bland <END>  same thing with the tzatziki  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I was very disappointed. I could have  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  the same  <START:O_Pay_Price> amount <END> , been even closer to work AND had an amazing  <START:Food> lunch <END>  if I had just went to Cafe Mix.
