I've heard  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's very much a chain and that  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not at all authentic Chinese  <START:Food> food <END> , however despite all that I have to admit the  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is quite a disconnect with the loud Rock  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  played in the dining  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  and the serene Chinese  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> , but I figure  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  works for somebody!  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> ginger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> broccoli <END>  and the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was quite  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are quite reasonable.  Just as long as you are not looking for authentic Chinese  <START:Food> dishes <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  will definitely  <START:Service> serve <END>  in a pinch.
 <START:O_Experience> great <END>  pho, my favorite  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  far in Pittsburgh. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  too!  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:W_Price> cash <END>  only but that's  <START:Opinion> fine <END>  as long as you prepare.
From the street, my husband and I thought Zoe's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  would be like Panera - that is, we thought  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would  <START:Service> serve <END>  fast,  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END> , and  <START:O_Experience> good <END> - <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  fare. None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the  <START:Food> food <END>  at Zoe's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  took  <START:W_Price> 30 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to come out and was disgustingly  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>  and in a few cases, quite gross. We stopped in for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  last week. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was packed, but the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  moved quickly,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our  <START:Food> food <END>  quickly.  <START:W_Price> more <END>  on that in a second. In terms of the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , we were shocked at how uninteresting the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  options seemed. Even though the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  was decently  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>  and we are open to lots of different types of  <START:Food> food <END>  and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option. Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  with no  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  were the grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> feta <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is 2008, and the non- <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  options at a  <START:Food> lunch <END>  spot should be  <START:W_Price> more <END>  imaginative than  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  slapped on some  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . In the end, I still ended up  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  the grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  (nothing else sounded  <START:O_Experience> good <END> !) and my husband selected the Greek  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Marinara. We sat down at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , displayed our number card, and just  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> . And  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> . And  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> . After literally  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for  <START:F_FI_Price> 25 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> , I checked in with the assistant  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  who was manning the pick-up counter.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  went into the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> , checked on our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , and said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would be just a "few  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> ."  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  even had a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  bring us two  <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  of  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  as some sort of  token of their sympathy, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  $2 for  <START:Food> each <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> slice <END> ! <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't until  <START:F_FI_Price> 10 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later when I lost my patience and told the same  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  that we wanted our  <START:Food> food <END>  immediately that we finally received  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Service> service <END> , but we found  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  un-acceptable that a non-full- <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  would take 35+  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to bring us two  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> . If  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  can't handle the catering, to-go, and eat-in  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  volume,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  should hire  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  members. As if the slow  <START:Service> service <END>  wasn't painful enough, my grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was completed charred (literally burned and black). After  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  bit of the accompanying  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END> , which was soaked in  <START:F_Ingredients> mayonnaise <END>  and soggy, I  immediately walked back to the assistant  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> , handed  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> , and asked  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  to refund me for my  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . To  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  credit,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  complied, but the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  had already been  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  and gross  <START:Food> food <END>  off and decide to return. My husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>  and completely un-memorable. The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was a plain  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  breast strips were formed and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  totally processed, and the "Greek" marinara  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like Prego. The only  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  part of his  <START:Food> meal <END>  was the side of bagged  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> !I guarantee you that we won't be back to Zoe's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> . We are huge  <START:Opinion> fans <END>  of fast, casual, and  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , but we found the  <START:Food> food <END>  at Zoe's to be  <START:Food> anything <END>  but.
Wow, that was  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  Chinese  <START:Food> food <END> .  I went at  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was packed and took about ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were a bit high but you get a ton of  <START:Food> food <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> good <END> ... the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are all Asian,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  want to get you in and out fast which is  <START:O_Experience> great <END> ...  I'll be back
Rokerij is our  <START:S_OpenHours> sunday <END>   <START:Food> brunch <END>  spot for $5  <START:F_Drinks> mimosas <END> . $5 make you hola.
 <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Offers> special <END>  and hot & sour  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  for takeout (note: I guess  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  is not included with the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Offers> special <END>  if you get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  for takeout,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  separately). I had to ask for the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  again because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't packed in my bag when I arrived. I really liked both  <START:Food> items <END> , especially the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , and the fried  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  side is  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END> . I'm not a huge  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>   <START:Opinion> fan <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  was pretty  <START:O_Experience> good <END> . I wish the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  came in smaller  <START:F_FI_Size> sizes <END> - 32 oz is a bit much for me, but hey,  <START:Food> leftovers <END> ! No  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  or  <START:Food> utensils <END>  were packed with my takeout which was odd, and inconvenient since I was going somewhere without silverware, but I found a spoon and managed! A few hang ups but overall I enjoyed the  <START:Food> food <END> - I will return.
 <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have my kind of casual  <START:Service> service <END> .  Never overly happy- in your face- bombarding  <START:Service> service <END> .  Your  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  asks if you're doing OK a couple of  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and if you need  <START:Food> anything <END>  after that, you just tell them.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a small  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  will always be near by.I always enjoy  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  honest to goodness  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  I've had the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggplant <END> , the fettuccine Alfredo,  <START:F_FoodItem> calzone <END>  and the Sicilian  <START:F_Appetizer> cookie <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  . . .all amazing!
After  <START:F_FI_Price> 10 <END> + years of  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  delivery from  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> , we are trying other places.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was close, fast and convenient but I realized i was getting  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  par  <START:Food> food <END>  in exchange.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  never put enough  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  in their  <START:Food> entrees <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  rangoon is cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and are stale every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we get them. We have had many of the same  <START:Food> dishes <END>  over the years and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  never improved  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  we are trying others places in the area.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  always give you extra  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  for your  <START:Food> food <END>  and the presentation in the bag was  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  but I want  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  in my sweet and sour  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  not just  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and 4  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  green  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  for example.  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .
I had a $ <START:F_FI_Price> 25 <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  voucher and that's enough for 2.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  really give  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  value but getting carried away with a lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  will guarantee boxed  <START:Food> leftovers <END> .  We ended up with a couple of  <START:F_FI_Quality> boxes <END> !We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  fajitas and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty average.  The cut of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  used for the fajitas was kinda weird, almost overly tender and would've been better for  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  were what would we expected them to be.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's hard to mess those up.  Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was very upbeat and friendly.   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:W_Price> more <END>  like 2.783346  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  and I'm pretty sure  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 'll be my last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  many other  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  for Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  around.
Got  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Healthy> poisoning <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  particular Taco Bell.  : (  Will never eat Taco Bell again.  I don't  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  how late you're open OR how much I've had to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> ... <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .   If you're looking for  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> ...go up the street to Fausto's or Roberto's.
I eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  nearly once every weekend.
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the fourth and final  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  we stopped at yesterday. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is small and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  isnt much of a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  to choose from. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  and he asked for our likes and dislikes. He altered our  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  to our liking and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were very  <START:O_Experience> good <END> . He handed us, in two seperate occasions, complimentary  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  that he felt we would like.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were both very  <START:O_Experience> good <END> . We would like to give  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  a solid 3 - 3.5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  but as we checked out we found that we were charged for  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  of the complimenary  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  by the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> . Maybe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a misunderstanding. Maybe we should have said something. We may go again because we really enjoyed the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  said he would "hook us up" next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  but we're worried of the spying  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  that may charge us again for a complimentary  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wont happen twice without a fight from us. We'll see....
I want to love  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Really, I want to love  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  sooo badly. But the truth is: go to San Francisco or Washington D.C. and get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> . As my (very white) Grandma would say: " <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is interesting." By which I mean,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are some ...flavors....and ... <START:F_Ingredients> spices <END> ... but nothing quite pulls together.At least the African Nut  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  and Injera are  <START:O_Experience> good <END> .
What a fun find!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a local mom and pop  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that really works hard to make their customers happy and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is definitely  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  which came with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was amazingly well  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  and had  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  after being in the  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was perfectly done and was a  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  add-on to sopping up that  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  and enjoying every last drop of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very friendly and checked in on us regularly. You could tell  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were a local favorite from all the conversation with the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  and the  <START:F_Drinks> patrons <END> . He knew them and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  them warmly.Overall,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a smaller  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  if you have a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  group I'd call ahead or get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  catered to your event. Overall: A+Perfect mom and pop local eatery.
The  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END> , and  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  are  <START:O_Experience> great <END> , but for the money you can get better elsewhere.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  "first  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END> "  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  or anniversary  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  when you want to talk during your  <START:Food> meal <END>  - nice and quiet.  I'll probably go back but not frequently.Try a Tequila Flight!  Very educational and a nice way to sample several  <START:F_Drinks> tequilas <END>  and not get plastered. <START:S_Staff> they <END>  could put just a little pizazz into  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  really neat - a "must do" activity.
Eh. That's about the best I can say about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's right next to our clinic,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  if I only have a few  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to grab  <START:Food> lunch <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I go.I'm not a  <START:Opinion> fan <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> teriyaki <END> , or chains,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  otherwise I wouldn't go  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  However,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do manage to properly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cook <END>  their  <START:F_FoodItem> broccoli <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's neither mushy nor hard, just perfectly green and crispy.  But that sickly sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> teriyaki <END>  needs to go.But their iced  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  is pretty  <START:O_Experience> good <END> .
YUMMY! <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and Simplicity are what make  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have those two important factors down!Their  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ! The  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have are par to non int the city.  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  of my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  is the 'Capacollo , Hard Salami & Provolone' on their outrageously wonderful white  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> ! I usually go for  <START:Food> wheat <END> , but I make the exception  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> !!  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are also a  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:Food> italian <END>  grocer for all your  <START:Food> italian <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  dough,  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> ,  <START:Food> italian <END>  goods, etc...The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are reasonable and you won't be disappointed!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is truly a little  <START:Food> italian <END>  gem in the  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END> . and very casual and low key, but  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> !I highly recommend Defalco's!P.S The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  can sometimes be long, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ! If you are in a hurry, CALL AHEAD!
Remember when Caffe Boa was right on Mill, next to Red Lantern and Long Wong's? Remember when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were doing inventive, handmade  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  and always had  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  specials? Remember the  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of flavors and the attention to detail? REMEMBER THE AGNOLOTTI??  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was nothing like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  in Tempe at the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .Yeah,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  ain't that anymore. Every red  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like Ketchup and  <START:F_FI_Taste> melted <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> margarine <END> . Every  <START:Food> food <END>  object  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like Sysco. I swear  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are still  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  crystals in the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's now a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for college kids to play grown-up  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> , and former  <START:Opinion> fans <END>  to hang their heads in sadness. I guess  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:S_Staff> serves <END>  its purpose as  <START:W_Price> more <END>  of a college  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> /practice  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . And its  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  is pleased with its easily-digested mediocrity. But I still lament the passing of the original, inspired Boa.RIP Boa.
I just placed an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  yesterday via online (VERY EASY PROCESS) for a meeting we were having today for our office and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did a  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  job!  <START:Food> each <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  was in  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's own little  <START:F_FI_Quality> box <END>  with  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END> 's name on them and  <START:Food> each <END>  had a side ( <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  got to choose  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  of the following:  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  Sliced Fruit  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , Frog Eyed  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  - sounds gross but VERY yummy) or a bag of  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> ), then  <START:Food> each <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> box <END>  also included a  <START:F_FoodItem> pickle <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> cookie <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> condiments <END>  and  <START:Food> utensils <END> . The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  to  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  that was another  <START:Opinion> plus <END>  in my book.We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  12 boxed  <START:Food> lunches <END>  to be  <START:S_Delivery> delivered <END>  and not only did every  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  up correctly but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Delivery> delivered <END>  5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  early! We will certainly be  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  from  <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>  Junction again!
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was alright. We came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on a Saturday afternoon.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was semi-full but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a lot of people  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  on to-go  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> . I  <START:A_Decor> pictured <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and  <START:Opinion> less <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the opposite.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had several  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END> 's and my pet-peeve. NO VOLUME why even have a  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END>  in the 1st  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ? OMG if you've read my reviews you know that is a deal killer for me. and I'll end up somewhere else. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and 2  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  must have annoyed  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  b/c we never saw  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  again?  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  spent the ENTIRE  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  kissing the next  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> 's ass. .and I mean giggling like a teenager at everything  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> 's  <START:F_Drinks> patrons <END>  had to say, and would by pass us like nothing. my bf finally said I guess my empty glass is invisible?  I figured  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  must have been. When we finally did get  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  attn and flagged  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  down to get the check -  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  whole tone changed. I guess the high pitched  <START:A_Entertainment> giggly <END>  tone and helpful attitude was reserved only for certain  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and ours wasnt up. Maybe we didnt spend enough? sorry but I'm only going to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  what I'm willing to actually eat.  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> : The  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  were ok. we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  HOT and  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cilantro <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cilantro <END>  had ZERO  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . I was really disappointed b/c I like both A LOT.  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  is up  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  w/  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  in my household. The hot  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  though, but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were very very very VERY greasy. I think i used every  <START:S_Cutlery> napkin <END>  in the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  than BWW or HOOters cant be  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  in the calorie dept. and the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  wasnt that far above and beyond  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  IMHO the nxt  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I go I'll probably try something else, and maybe get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to go to avoid bad  <START:S_Staff> waitressing <END> .
After hearing either really bad or really  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  reviews of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> , I decided to give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a try...and came out with a rather unassuming average review instead!  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Factory is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in a plain and slightly seedy looking  <START:Restaurant> strip mall <END> . Being from the East Coast, I know that most  <START:O_Experience> good <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  are not in the best of  <START:A_Environment> neighborhoods <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  I was excited... <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  was also run down, but not terrible inside.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was tacky a bit dirty, but definitely inviting in a "homey" type of way. <START:Service> service <END>  was average. We had to ask our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  quite a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  to refill my  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> , but  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  always obliged and often walked by and never disappeared.  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  attitude was rather aloof, but  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  "blessed" us with  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  smile a couple of  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  average rating  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  gets.We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  some nigiri,  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END> . I wasn't in a mood (for once) to eat a lot :).  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END>  were, how do I say  <START:Restaurant> this <END> ?, pretty  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> . I didn't expect for these to be  <START:O_Experience> good <END> , but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were. Not the best I've had by any means, but definitely  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was edible and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  as well, however,  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  was not the freshest and presentation was rather poor.  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  were the best part of the  <START:Food> meal <END> , and had very  <START:O_Experience> good <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  to them.  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were incredibly cheap for a  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .Overall, I may come back to  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Factory, but only because my best friend lives across the street. I will not make a  <START:Offers> special <END>  trip to go  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , as  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  many better  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  places in Vegas...However, if I'm in a  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>  and craving some  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , and running low on money $$$$ I will stop by and  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Factory again.
My  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and I ventured in to Battistas last week for  <START:Food> dinner <END> , and as with all my other visits to the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  over the last 20 years, had a pleasant dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  and the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is unique with its  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END> -gone-by feel.  Gordo (I think that's his name), the accordion player, has been  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  on every visit.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's probably not the best  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  in the area, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  break from all the over-the- <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  that churn the $ around the strip.
I guess its not bad, we checked in and were given a smoking  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had no others, we were not thrilled about that, but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were fully booked. After getting to the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  I decided to call the front desk to ask if we could have a 12pm check out, I called from the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  phone and after 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  of no  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  answering I called from my cell phone as well and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  and finally someone answered after about  <START:F_FI_Price> 25 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> , and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did let us check out at 12 but still if its pretty busy  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  I don't see how no  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  could have answered the phone a little quicker just to answer a quick question.
Going to eat  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  at  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  hidden gem (really) in  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  of the last of the dingy  <START:A_Entertainment> casinos <END>  on the Las Vegas strip was  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  of the high  <START:A_Decor> lights <END>  of our recent trip! I told my hubby let's go see if  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> steakhouse <END>  is as really  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  as the reviews said and he asked me, are you sure  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's in Circus Circus? LOL!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> steakhouse <END>  is a trip back in  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to classic , classy,  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  ole fashioned carnivore eating  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  for  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  folks who want to  <START:Service> treat <END>  themselves on a well earned vacation. We are around 50 and truly enjoy  <START:O_Experience> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> steakhouse <END>  did not disappoint!! Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was Michael who turned out he has been with the  <START:Restaurant> steakhouse <END>  for over 20 years and was excellent. Classic  <START:Service> service <END>  from all the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  without being snooty. How's the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  you ask, I had the porterhouse  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and hubby had the  <START:F_FoodItem> bone <END> -in prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END> , both  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  medium. Excellent  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  much  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  that when chewing you couldn't stop thinking about what you were tasting from  <START:Food> each <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . Our  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  were most enjoyable as an understated  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> response <END> ! Now the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END> , please do yourself a favor and don't eat much the  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  you plan to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . These  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  and huge! The  <START:F_FoodItem> bone <END>  in prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  is the biggest hunk of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  I've ever seen my hubby eat and he made a very  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  run at  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I did pretty well on my porterhouse too. The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  also  <START:Opinion> deserves <END>  a note because the selection is very  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  as well, esp. the pretzel  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . I can't help to think that  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  ole Circus Circus will be gone and I hope  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> steakhouse <END>  gets a home somewhere else. But for now, I'm  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  glad we ventured  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and tried  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was well  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the money and  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ; we'll be back!!
Comfort  <START:Food> food <END>  overload.  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  talks about their humongo  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  pot pie, but did you realize  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a $2-$ <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 7 <END>  Happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  daily? 3: <START:W_Price> 30 <END> - <START:F_FI_Price> 6 <END> : <START:W_Price> 30 <END>  mon-Friday and Saturday in the morning sometime I think  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's 11-4.  <START:S_OpenHours> sunday <END>  is funday because happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  is all  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  long!  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 've spruced up the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and I hope that  <START:W_Price> more <END>  fun, young locals start hanging out  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  as  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's close to my home. Would love to meet ya!
 <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>   <START:Opinion> deserves <END>  a second chance, despite my previous review/comment about second chances at such exorbitant  <START:W_Price> prices <END> .I get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ...I really do. The fancy dining sofa's, ass kissing  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Experience> iron skillets <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's all  <START:O_Experience> good <END> . But what's the use of  <START:S_Stf_Experience> iron skillets <END>  if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't provide heat? My $ <START:W_Price> 60 <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> filet <END>  was cold...once again. I hate sending  <START:Food> food <END>  back. I won't do  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I shouldn't have to.Sorry, I got ahead of myself. I jumped to the  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  course.The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  is very  <START:O_Experience> good <END> . That particular iron skillet  <START:S_Delivery> delivered <END> . I'm reluctant to Yelp  <START:Food> anything <END>  is  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  in a sentence because that may become a YELP  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  highlight.CraftSteak's beet  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END> . I don't necessarily like salty  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  that says a lot. Maybe add a chunk of  <START:F_FoodItem> goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . Not daring to be different, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a classic pairing. But hey, beets are  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  for me,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  I'll move on...The risotto was  <START:O_Experience> good <END> , with all the  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END> , bits and  <START:F_FI_Size> pieces <END> , but was  <START:Service> served <END>  CRUNCHY al dente. The  <START:F_FoodItem> filet <END> ...well you know about my  <START:F_FoodItem> filet <END> . Other than  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  being coldededed,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was, yes, under  <START:Offers> seasoned <END>  and  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END> . Try a Ruth's Chris  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  hot, moist and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END> .Oh, oh, oh....my Dark and Stormy,  <START:F_Ingredients> ginger <END>  and rum  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> great <END> .The  <START:Service> service <END>  was very  <START:O_Experience> good <END> , but I sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . That's my thing when I want  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:Service> service <END> . That's a no brainer.No  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  tonight, even though the Monkey  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  is  <START:Opinion> fan <END> -fuckin-tastic! YELP highlight that!Lucky to be alone tonight. Only $146 for  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END> .
I recently went for  <START:Food> brunch <END>  due to hype from  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  of my co-workers.  I did not like much about my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  started with what I think is an obscure way to get to the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , to the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , to  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  I am certain the Illy  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  downstairs is much better than what I had upstairs.  The  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  was  <START:W_Price> basic fare <END>  and included what I considered a overbaked  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  almond  <START:F_FoodItem> croissant <END> .  My girlfriend did like  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> waffle <END> .  Ultimately, I left undazzled by  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> ,  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> .  I went back downstairs thinking maybe I should have just tried a  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> croissant <END>  from the  <START:A_Places> bakery <END> .
We had high expectations for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was all our friends raved about. Although the selection was  <START:O_Experience> great <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  was mediocre (should that be expected in a  <START:Food> buffet <END> ?)The  <START:Food> buffet <END>  overall Our Rating (on a scale from 1- <START:F_FI_Price> 10 <END> ;  <START:F_FI_Price> 10 <END>  being the best): 7Ambiance/ <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> :  <START:F_FI_Price> 6 <END>  - The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was okay. Lots of people and we sat in the corner, which was nice. However,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  felt much like being in a  <START:Restaurant> cafeteria <END>  and that detracted a little from our  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . <START:Service> service <END> : 5 - The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  would come pick up our  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  occassionally but with a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  party  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  stacked up quickly. However,  <START:Food> each <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  came by,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was very friendly, as was the rest of the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> .We havent been to many  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  in Vegas, but from what we've eaten  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  was pretty  <START:O_Experience> good <END> .

We were arriving in Vegas late and we knew we wouldn't have  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to get all "glamed" out,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  we looked for something low key and Diego's  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was (I found  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  on Yelp.)No cover chargeDrinks are super inexpensiveGreat MusicOpen until 3P on FridaysA little bit hidden in the MGM
Stopped by  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  with my wife after seeing the Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian.  I have never been a  <START:Opinion> fan <END>  of the  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  Factory  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  I knew walking in that I would probably have a similar opinion of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  Huge  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , daunting really, I had a tough  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  making any kind of a decision but finally settled on the lasagna.  Maybe I didn't read the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  well enough, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  came out with  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  in  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ?  Wasn't bad but wasn't  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  either.   <START:Service> service <END>  was OK, nothing to write home about.
 <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:Opinion> fantastic <END> . I are  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for both  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  and for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and both had  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END> . Would have had 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> , but heard a lot of moaning and groaning from the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  thought people would not be able to hear...
I used to be a  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>   <START:Opinion> fan <END>  of The  <START:Food> buffet <END>  at the Wynn, with its insane  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of meaty goodness, vegan and vegetarian options for those who want to live a healthier lifestyle, and a  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  packed full of  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  that always made me feel a little like Willie Wonka. I used to tell people  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the best  <START:Food> buffet <END>  on the Vegas Strip, but I am no longer a  <START:Opinion> fan <END> .  My last visit  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was just before Labor  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  weekend, and was very disappointing.  The veal short  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  was the only  <START:Food> dish <END>  that was truly exceptional, while everything else I sampled was just  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  lackluster: the fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was on par with the kind my local grocery store sells by the greasy boxful, the Cajun  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  loin was flavorless and didn't inspire me to Zydeco, and the sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> pea <END>  risotto was  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>  and a little too crunchy for my liking.Even my favorite go-to  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  seemed to have been replaced with piteous knock-offs that left a chilling "Invasion of the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  Snatchers" vibe in the air. The  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  pops and  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  pops I once loved  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were now store-bought  <START:F_Dessert> marshmallows <END>  that were coated in a humdrum icing and violently impaled on a stick. The gelato that was once bustling with exciting flavors was now deferential and hesitant.         The  <START:Service> service <END> , too, was seriously lacking. While  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  are often frequently refilled at most  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  (and  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> ), our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> 's appearances could be best described as spectral: he showed up at the start of the  <START:Food> meal <END>  and was never seen or heard from again. If he has  <START:W_Price> 40 <END>  years younger, I would have initiated an Amber Alert.  Sadly, no  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  came by at any  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to pick up the pile of used  <START:Food> dishes <END>  that were quickly accumulating on our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  either.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  got  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  ridiculous that we decided to clear the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  ourselves and  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  our many  <START:Food> dishes <END>  on the empty, four-seater across from us. Even sadder, a lone  <START:Food> diner <END>  was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  at that very  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  shortly thereafter, with  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  oblivious to the Jenga tower of  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  and unappetizing  <START:Food> leftovers <END>  erected diagonally across from  <START:S_Staff> her <END> .           On the up side, many of the  <START:Food> diners <END>  seemed to be enamored with the giant  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs that were pouring endlessly out of the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> .  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  were filled two and three feet high with these savory crustaceans that was a high point of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END> . These  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> -loving guests tended to ignore the other offerings available to them. Were  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  in the know? Or were  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  just for the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> ?The immense popularity of the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  leg station and the sheer volume being consumed by some  <START:Food> diners <END>  who seemed almost unhinged in their pursuit to up the levels of Omega-3s in their systems seemed to be the "raison d'être" for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END> .Maybe  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the reason that the Wynn has just given up? Sure, the presentation and vibrant  <START:A_Decor> colors <END>  of the many  <START:Food> meals <END>  at  <START:Food> each <END>  station really stood out, appealed to the eye, and made me want to try everything. But  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  almost felt like the offerings  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs were just  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> , along with the inedible flower arrangements and the decorative flourishes that adorn  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  dining hall and provide  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with its  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is my favorite Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  in town.  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END> ,  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> , and just overall  <START:O_Experience> good <END> .Kid friendly, funky  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> ,  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection.I like the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chorizo <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  the best.
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  was very  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  give is yummy don't eat to much of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  you'll get full. The fettuccine Alfredo was  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was very tender except i seen a  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on yelp and my Alfredo had no  <START:F_FoodItem> broccoli <END> ,  my boyfriend had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> saltimbocca <END>  which he said was really  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  all together  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was wonderful  <START:O_Experience> good <END>   <START:Service> services <END>  and not to  <START:W_Price> expensive <END> 
I did some trade out work for Johnny's uptown for fixing his register system.  I charge $ <START:F_FI_Price> 75 <END>  per  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  a fairly cheap  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  ($ <START:W_Price> 175 <END>  per  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  for the geek squad).   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  took me two  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  to climb through all his rafters and trace down a network break.  He was fixed within 4  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  of calling me at 4 P.M.  Most places would have stuck him with a  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  of over $500  for last minute and evening surcharges.  My boyfriend (Johnny's  <START:S_Staff> employee <END> ) and I shared a stake and a bottle of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> .  Retail  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  was $ <START:F_FI_Price> 85 <END>   his  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  discount made  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  $42.  I asked John Tallifer if he wanted me to  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  him or he could trade out.  I have never seen some  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  gripe about  <START:Offers> saving <END>  $450  <START:W_Price> more <END>  in my life.Like an Idiot I did some newspaper ads for him 2 of them for $100  again no foresight he called me 2  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  before  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were due.Then I did a sign for him for his other failing  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  Melrose caf I created 12 beautiful logos for his sign and a magazine made him 3  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  wanted to charge him a grand for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . He sat behind me for 4  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  and directed me how he envisioned  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  atrocity he had me create.  I charged him $160 he loved the sign.  I realize why straight men are not designersAfter  <START:W_Price> 30 <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>  of not  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  me he offered, to trade out  <START:Food> dinner <END>  for 4.  My boyfriend's uncle was in town  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  we went to Johnny's to eat.  My  <START:F_FoodItem> filet <END>  was  <START:Opinion> fantastic <END> ; the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  was cold,  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  and had been frozen before. The  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  and the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  came to $400 well $200 for  <START:S_Staff> employees <END> .  Again he bitched about  <START:Offers> saving <END>  a grand, called my partner a silly faggot and his black  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  who set up the deal a stupid Nword.  My boyfriend quit and we left.
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is definitely a spot in Las Vegas to come to if you're looking for a famous  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  that sells  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  that is presented well. I almost want to say that even if you don't have a car in Vegas,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  getting a taxi out  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  even though  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  might be like $ <START:W_Price> 30 <END>  to get  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Since I had a car on my last trip, I dropped by  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . I'm pretty sure  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  gets a lot  <START:W_Price> more <END>  attention and fame since Man Vs.  <START:Food> food <END>  came  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the "Andy's Sage Fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  &  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuit <END> " and the "Kiwi Watermelon  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> ." The presentation was amazing and I would recommend getting  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  especially if you're into  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  & Waffles. Personally, I am not into that combination but I wanted to try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  anyway because of all the  <START:Service> recommendations <END> . I don't think anyone puts  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  in the  <START:F_FoodItem> waffle <END> --interesting. I sort of wish I got something else after seeing other peoples'  <START:Food> dishes <END>  but I still enjoyed what I got.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was amazing and the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was lively. I would come back for sure but maybe at a different  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  to see how different  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  all are. I think that  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  is the  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> . Since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not on the strip, the street isn't that busy and  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  isn't impossible.
 <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  &  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> .  Would definitely recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to anyone visiting Vegas.  Something you wouldn't be able to do anywhere else.
Nice find in the Convention Center area of Pittsburgh.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  is very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:Food> entrees <END>  are nicely presented and quite delectable.
What  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is, is awesome  <START:Food> food <END>  without the hefty  <START:W_Price> price <END>  tag.   As everybody has said, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .  Tried the new england clam chowder, raw  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END>  and combo pan  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roast <END> .  Mmmmmmm.  Best clam chowder I've tried, beats even those from the Bay area.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't skimp on the seafood and the base for the  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  is very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .I am surprised that people give bad reviews of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  just because of the  <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's about a million reviews  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  that say  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a lot of  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  why are people surprised?   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , not a michelin-rated  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .   The  <START:Service> service <END>  can be improved, but what can you do?   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not like any of the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is slacking.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  definitely work hard and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  try to be fast and friendly.Come out mid week around 2 am and you won't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  long.
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the only  <START:Food> buffet <END>  I have eaten at in Vegas and I love  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ! For around $ <START:F_FI_Price> 25 <END>  you get an all you can eat  <START:Food> buffet <END>  with  <START:O_Experience> good <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> food <END> . I am not sure if  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  feature, but house  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  were also included in the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END> . Score! The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is really helpful -  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  of the  <START:S_Staff> hostesses <END>  went out of  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  way to find us the house  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  when we noticed  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had already  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  down the " <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ."Upon entering, you can  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for your  <START:Food> meal <END>  at a kiosk which is super helpful if you're with a group and want separate checks -  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's already taken  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  of! Then you get  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  and eat until your waistband can't take  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  anymore. <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't take  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  when my friends and I arrived.
the CRYING BABIES were awful,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is not a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for kids at all.  We left,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasnot a  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> 
My friends referred to the  <START:Food> meal <END>  as "terrible" and "atrocious." I would not go that far, but a lot of little things added up to make our dinners  <START:Opinion> less <END>  than satisfactory. The broth of the  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  bo hue was not very  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END> . On the other hand, the broth of the spicy pho was way too spicy. The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  in the  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  looked completely unappetizing. The  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  hard and rubbery  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  could not be cut with a spoon.The grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  banh mi was the only thing that was okay, but I have had better banh mi for the same  <START:W_Price> price <END>  elsewhere.
 <START:O_Experience> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , we had a  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  first,  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  and crispy, then a all  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  which was  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  but not the best I've ever had. Reason for 3  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  is, paper  <START:S_Cutlery> cups <END>  and you get your  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  yourself, kinda cheesy for such a nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
Get ready to get dirty.  Oh yeah, don't be wearing white. Be comfy, cuz u gonna use your hands!  Fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to try. Wish we had a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  in Hawaii.  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> :-2 lbs of the crawfish. The hot n juicy  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  with the extra spicy level. (of course) -fingerlickin  <START:O_Experience> good <END> , tear ducts  <START:F_Drinks> watering <END> , nose running.... <START:F_FI_Taste> yumminess <END> .-Softshell  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  (comes with fries) -  <START:O_Experience> good <END> -4  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  - same ole, same oleEnvironmentFairly clean. Wooden  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> , some  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END> , casual.ServiceDecent.  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was okay, a little ditzy, but okay. TipWhen u get  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , the person taking your name down for the waitlist may say, "go to the other NEW  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  down the block,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> ." WRONG, do not listen. We were smart enough to put our name on the list then check out the "new"  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> ....yup, even looongger  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> !  Lame.  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  we went back to the original  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  just 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> ! Not much  <START:S_Parking> parking <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  CARPOOL or go early!
Honestly,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:Opinion> deserve <END>  a 0 or negative  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  rating.  I've never been  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  sick from  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Healthy> poisoning <END>  in my life.We visited for their  <START:Offers> special <END>  Mother's  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>   <START:Food> brunch <END>  that is chocked full of  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Food> foods <END> ; AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  claws,  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END> , clams, swordfish and many  <START:W_Price> more <END>  for $69/ <START:Food> each <END> .  While  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's nothing exotic about the  <START:Food> food <END>  preparation,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's seriously  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  We tried the Zefferino house labeled  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END>  that was on  <START:Offers> special <END>  for the  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  left a lot to be desired.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was mediocre at best; refills were difficult, the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  ofter forgot our requests, forcing us to follow up when we could catch him.  The deceptively  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  was enjoyed by all, until after the  <START:Food> meal <END> .   <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  in our party of 8 grew violently ill from  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Healthy> poisoning <END> .   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was the only  <START:Food> meal <END>  we ate all  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> , which we would  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for all  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  long.  I don't know if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  us  <START:Food> food <END>  past its expiration  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>  or if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  stored the  <START:Food> food <END>  improperly, but I'm quite traumatized by  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  horrific dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .
Cheap and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . A level above fast  <START:Food> food <END> . I had the Thai  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wrap <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was peanuts with  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  for only $ <START:F_FI_Price> 6 <END>  and my husband had the  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  with provolone  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and pepperoni and other  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> . Also the same  <START:W_Price> price <END> . A  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for a quick  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat.
Came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for a bday  <START:Food> dinner <END> ..and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sat us in our own private area on the side, which was perfect.  $ <START:F_FI_Price> 25 <END>  for all you can eat and that pretty much included everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  besides  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END> ...  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had many  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  to choose from and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also had yakitori  <START:Food> dishes <END> ( <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wrapped <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END> ), poke  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> ( <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ), poke bowls,  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END> , mussels..  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  selection.  Since we had a  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  party, our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  took some  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and some got missed but the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were  <START:W_Price> more <END>  than helpful and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  made sure we got everything we wanted.  After our  <START:Food> meals <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also had parfait,  <START:F_FoodItem> mochi <END> , and tiramisu for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ..I would definitely be coming back..Only downer is that  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is pretty far from the strip if you don't have a car, its about a $ <START:W_Price> 30 <END>  cab ride, but if you split  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , its not  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  bad.  After 2  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  of stuffing our faces and many bottles of sake, we left stuffed and satisfied and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  only came out to $ <START:W_Price> 40 <END>  a person! We were expecting way  <START:W_Price> more <END> !
Unfortunately  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was not the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  house we thought  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would be.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was " <START:O_Experience> good <END> ", not  <START:O_Experience> great <END> .  The  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  (fondue) came the same  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  our  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  did.  I asked to have them take the  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  back until we were done with the fondue, the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  argued.  I think if the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  is close to $ <START:F_FI_Price> 300 <END>   <START:Opinion> plus <END> , we should not have to argue with the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> .  All in all, I would try another  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in Vegas for the money.
Awesome!   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  rocks!   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  is  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  homemade stuff.  Really different than pretty much  <START:Food> italian <END>  type  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .
New  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> , Matt, us making Blue Wasabi relevant again.   <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  &  <START:F_Drinks> martinis <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  Poke is excellent...try the "Chuck Norris"  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> , edemame and  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with any of their  <START:F_Drinks> martinis <END> ... <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  doesn't disappoint.  Ashley, on your first  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>   <START:S_Staff> serving <END> , nice job!
I love coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  when the UNLV Runnin' Rebels are playing away  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END> . Gather round some  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  with friends. The  <START:Food> food <END>  really is better than you would expext everytime. Can't beat  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> !
The  <START:F_Ingredients> salted <END>  caramel brownie might be the best sweet I've ever had!  Wasn't terribly impressed with their  <START:F_FoodItem> croissants <END> , which is what kept me from giving 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .
 <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> good <END> .   <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are a little  <START:F_Ingredients> nuts <END>  for what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is but that's Vegas I guess.
Yet another  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  stop in Charlotte...what is  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> ...who knew  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would house  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  many  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  places to eat! Anyway - love the feel of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  is also  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>  notch. I would highly recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> blacked brie <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tenders as an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> . Brie I am always a  <START:Opinion> fan <END>  of - but I love the paring - put a little bit (or a lot depending on how much of a  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  lover you are) on the ciabatta  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END> , then  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  off with a  <START:F_FI_Size> slice <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>  and then a dollop of the apricot cranberry chutney -  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ! And the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tenders....I normally hate  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tenders, but these were  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  tender and jam packed with buffalo  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> , I couldn't help myself to reach for another  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END> . Now when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  comes to  <START:Food> dinner <END> , I am not going to lie - you are going to have a hard  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  picking something out since everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  looks  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:O_Experience> good <END> . I mean  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  took me almost  <START:W_Price> 30 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to decide - I kept on going back and forth on a couple of things - but I am happy to say I made the right  <START:S_Menu> choice <END> . I was a bit nervous since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a little out of the  <START:F_FI_Quality> box <END>  for me - but when I took my first  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of the Hong Kong Style Chilean Sea Bass - I thought my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  buds were going to explode.  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> rich <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . The sea bass just  <START:F_FI_Taste> melted <END>  in my mouth. Oh and the  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END>  that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  come with are to die for. Again, I was a bit nervous since I don't like  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> , but the  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>  defiantly balances  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out. The only thing I didn't really like were the snow  <START:F_Ingredients> peas <END>  -  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were a bit too  <START:F_FI_Healthy> oily <END>  for me. And  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  since we had such a  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  with both our  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  and  <START:Food> dinner <END>  - of course we had to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ...or should I say  <START:F_Dessert> dessertsssss <END> . We had the BlackFinn Hot  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  which was very decant,  <START:F_FI_Quality> rich <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> chocolaty <END> , and  <START:F_Ingredients> peanut <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END> . But regardless of how  <START:O_Experience> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was, I focused myself on the Season Fruit  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  would have to be by far the best  <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END>  I have ever had. These super HUGE crumbs were  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  packed with  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . Again, another  <START:Food> item <END>  that just  <START:F_FI_Taste> melted <END>  in your mouth. I had to literately stop myself from grabbing the  <START:Food> dish <END>  to eat the whole thing myself.If I ever come to Charlotte again,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  will be my first stop!
I have been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , howevery most recent visit was not  <START:O_Experience> good <END> . Took a  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  to get a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , and only  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> ...  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  slow. The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was nice, but definitely a rookie,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were multiple  <START:S_Staff> managers <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , we were the only  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  of about 15 do you think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would help the rookie? Not  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , terrible  <START:Service> service <END> .  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  offered nothing to compensate. Very disappointed!
Amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , and fun  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> ! I loved how you can just flip a card over and then you are just flooooded with people giving you different  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  in your face. Had our business Christmas  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> , back in December and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was perfect. The sides were also amazing (mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  - YUM!) Definitely give  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  a try if you have  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  to stretch your stomach.
I love  <START:O_Experience> great <END> -tasting and  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  at a steal!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is what  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  offers. Make sure you have Anthony as your  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END> . He is the best! Poor  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  practically lives  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , he said he works 12  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  a  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> ,  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 7 <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>  a week. Even though he works that much, he still makes awesome  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  consistently.We came across  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  when we found out that Naked  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  was  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  for renovations. We're very glad we made that accidental discovery!Their  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END> , I don't even think I'm eating raw  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> . I only started eating raw  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  recently, when I discovered how  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  yellowtail nigiri was at SushiMon. No offense to SushiMon, but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  joint made me love eating yellowtail nigiri  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  much  <START:W_Price> more <END> ! Another  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  I love is the  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> !For the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  of $ <START:F_FI_Price> 23.99 <END>  ( <START:Food> dinner <END> ) and $ <START:F_FI_Price> 18.99 <END>  (happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  2-5  <START:S_OpenHours> pm <END> ), I think  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  checking out.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have really  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  tasting specialty  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  too,  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  of them which is the Stacie  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> . Two thumbs up to Anthony for making  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:O_Experience> great <END> . <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END>  thing, their tamago is probably the freshest tamago I have ever tried anywhere. I could probably go to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and just  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  tamago after tamago after tamago, because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is that  <START:O_Experience> good <END> !  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  takes forever to make though, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .The  <START:Service> service <END>  has been excellent during both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  we were  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was not  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END>  both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  (I don't get why  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  isn't, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:O_Experience> good <END> !)  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  are dedicated to you and probably two other groups.Do check out  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> ! The  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  isn't too  <START:O_Experience> good <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's on Durango (and  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's never any traffic on Durango) and Flamingo, by the Salvation Army. But trust me,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the trip!By the way,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have $35.99 All you can eat and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  ( <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END> ) too if you're a heavy drinker.
 <START:Service> service <END>  was fast,  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> great <END> , I don't see why  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  many people on  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  write bad reviews about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,will be returning
Very  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ! Everything was very  <START:O_Experience> good <END> . My favorite was the black  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with the Georgia peach BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The burnt ends were  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  but a pretty small app. The collard greens and sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  fries were my favorite sides. The applesauce and  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END>   <START:Offers> special <END>  were overrated for me but my brother loved  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> !  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to go if you want to have a slightly  <START:Opinion> less <END>  exhausting  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .
Pricey  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  but its  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Normally when I want a quick fix I hit up  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END>  places but when I'm in the mood for  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  with a friend, I go to Akaihana.
I've had a lot of BJs.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  by far was the worst BJ I have ever received. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was slow and not in a  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  of way. If your going for a birthday  <START:Food> dinner <END> , you might be  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  to see their next birthday. Never again.
Everything was  <START:Opinion> fantastic <END> . We did the signature  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and were very impressed. As  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  as the  <START:Food> food <END>  was, our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  Marcus was the  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  of the  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> . Probably  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  of the best  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  I've ever had the pleasure of dining with. Sage is extremely lucky to have you Marcus, thank you for your superior  <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  meant a lot to us.
Upon first glance  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is appears to be a very usual  <START:Restaurant> strip mall <END>  type  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  but behind the black glass lies a  <START:W_Price> more <END>  unusual  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and grill.We went on a  <START:S_OpenHours> sunday <END>  for the Jets-Ravens  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a fun  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ..  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  of those places you likely have passed a hundred  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  on the way to work or going to Scottsdale using Indian School Rd.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is set back into the  <START:Restaurant> strip mall <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  you would not see  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  from the street. Why Teakwoods is  <START:Offers> special <END>  comes from its extremely  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  which you would not expect from a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that lets you throw  <START:F_Ingredients> peanut <END>  shells on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END> . Like most  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has a bevy of  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END> 's and a rowdy but pleasant  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was really  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  though I would never call  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  " <START:Opinion> fine <END>  dining". An extremely  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go when you want to be stuffed with semi-greasy  <START:Food> food <END> ..I had their famous  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and I can honestly say  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were outrageous. I especially liked the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  balls which are hard to find as WineBurger stopped carrying them.No particular reason  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  wasn't 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .. <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  just didnt have that 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  feel..maybe in the future when I go back.
The pretzels  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like cheap white  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like velveeta. The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  looks like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put a pushcart vendor indoors.
Best  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  in the East Valley!I found out about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  on Yelp and decided to try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  on a whim.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  right across the street another  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in the area I frequent  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  I was shocked that I never heard of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  before.When I first stepped in I was kindly  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  by the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  (who was also the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END> ) and we exchanged a few pleasantries before I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . You can see him cooking clear as  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  from any  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  which is fairly uncommon and impressive for a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  joint. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a simple  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with cheddar  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and combo'd  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with fries. The total was under $ <START:F_FI_Price> 10 <END>  but I would have gladly  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .The  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was superb. Better than any other  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I've been to.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  puts Islands, Five Guys, In n Out to shame in both  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , presentation, and value. I couldn't stop eating  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> , packed with  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> , and  <START:Offers> seasoned <END>  beautifully.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  cut of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  that was complimented very well by the perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> buns <END>  and their  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The fries were  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> , plentiful, incredibly crispy, and included a ramekin of their  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  for dipping (which I quickly ran out of).I've never felt  <START:W_Price> more <END>  satisfied and pleased after finishing a  <START:Food> meal <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was  <START:A_Places> portioned <END>  and perfectly  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>  and I probably could have wolfed down another  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of fries with  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  easily.The best part about my visit was that the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  was amazingly kind and friendly. We chatted afterwards and he was genuinely passionless about his  <START:Food> food <END> , something that I think a lot of other  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  places have lost through the "automation" of delivery.I can't recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  highly enough.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is definitely  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  a drive out  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . I will be sure to frequent  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  from now on!
I'm mad at myself after seeing their Facebook ad months ago that I wasted  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  & money on other  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END> -called "Chicago-style"  <START:Ambience> establishments <END> . You want real Chicago-style  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  AND  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END> ? Well, look no further!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is where you need to go. I tried the  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with the works Saturday, &  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the best  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  I have had in months. Today I got their  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  ...  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  beats Portillo's by a  <START:A_Env_Type> landslide <END>  ... The fries are the best, and try a  <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END> , too, you won't be disappointed since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's made with  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  ... OMG pure Chicago heaven. Bringing a friend from back home (Chicago)  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  tomorrow and I think I will either get a  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  or a Chicago  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  ... & another  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>   <START:F_Drinks> shake <END> . And I met the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  today (yes, he's from Chi-town) ... What a  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:S_Staff> guy <END> ! Hats off to you, Lobby!! :)
Very  <START:W_Price> expensive <END>  but I do believe that you get what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  certainly did a  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  job on the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> . We came late on a monday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is about 3/4 full,  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  about 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the following: <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  Cones: ahi  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  filled inside won ton, very very  <START:O_Experience> good <END> ! white ceviche: white  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , goes  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  with the chipspan tomate:  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  very  <START:O_Experience> good <END> ! <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  spanish  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  croquetas |grilled angus flat iron  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  grilled  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  choplobster saffronmarinera PAELLAS, the best I ever had  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  spain!  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  say the  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  is for 2 ppl but I think  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:W_Price> more <END>  than enough for 4 ppl!Overall a  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  dinning  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and will come back when I win  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  at the  <START:A_Entertainment> casinos <END> !
Yummy  <START:Food> food <END>  and very nice people! Awesome  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  and benedict! <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> berries <END>  were super  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  creme. Benedict has savory  <START:F_Ingredients> potatos <END>  and  <START:Opinion> fantastic <END>  hollandaise  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The tarragon  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuit <END>  underneath is a  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  base.
 <START:O_Experience> great <END>  local  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . Usually decent  <START:Service> service <END>  both  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  and  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . I've  <START:A_Entertainment> gambled <END>  and didn't get any  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  comp'd, but  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END>  aren't bad.  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  is actually a  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  thing  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . Love the  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>   <START:A_Furniture> chairs <END>  in the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area's  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  section too.
 <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  will  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  you about $ <START:F_FI_Price> 80 <END>  (including a decent tip) for two  <START:Food> entrees <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  app of  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  Stella draft.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> good <END> , but nothing over the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> good <END> , but our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was in a rush to do  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  job.  I wouldn't recommend Wolfgang Puck unless you just wanna sit at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and have a wood fired  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  with a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .
Forget abt the earlier post abt their acceptable ramen.  Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  just a few  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>  ago and its ramen is on par with republic ramen, equally bad.Pls go to  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Ken, that is really the only  <START:O_Experience> good <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  ramen.   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  their spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  ramen  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .The ramen  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is 3  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> pieces <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  and some "western"  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END>  and brocoli.  yes, its that bad.  if i wanted  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  kind of stuff, those packet ramen  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  would be better.
We aren't  <START:A_Entertainment> sports <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  people, but we really enjoyed  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Crazy  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  thingy I had. My 19-yr  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  son  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  some kind of gi-normous  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  that had an  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  on  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  impressive that a  <START:F_Drinks> patron <END>  walking by had to stop and comment on  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I didn't think too much about their  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> ...I prefer Wing King in Fort Mill...but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were passable. We stopped in  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> , starving, and found the entire  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  focused on the Carolina-Clemson  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> .  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and we had a fun  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , even though we are actually MN Gopher  <START:Opinion> fans <END> !
The best part about coming to Duckworth's is the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> . With that being said, the best  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>  to come and enjoy a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  are Tues & Thurs when most of the 50 or  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have on draft are $3.00. Those are the best  <START:S_OpenHours> nights <END>  to come and experiment with new  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  and try something different. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is a little bit above average  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , nothing  <START:Offers> special <END>  going on  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  isn't bad either. Be warned, if you come on $3  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  might be tough to find a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  4.5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  in my book. From the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  as a tourist  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  doesn't look like much but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have some amazing BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> . I had their Pan Fried  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  and that was just ok but that BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  though. That was awesome.
Sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  due to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> ... World  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  was on and  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was packed. <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for  <START:Service> service <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was beyond abysmal.  I mean truly  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END> .  I got a bed sore on the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Furniture> stool <END> .That said, he was friendly and helpful when we had his attention and the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , though abnormally gigantic, we're  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .The sake recommend was decent and reasonably priced.I've been before and I'll go again.
Awesome  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  along State Street (on the end closer to the capital bldg) <START:O_Experience> great <END>  Pilsner that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  brew right  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .Accept credit cards.  What  <START:W_Price> more <END>  could you want?
Just back from the Wicked Spoon.... <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's definitely the WORST  <START:Food> buffet <END>  I've ever been for  <START:Food> dinner <END> . Incredibly long  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> --Only to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  and then  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in a SECOND long  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> ...about 1.5  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .  $35 per person... <START:S_Staff> server <END>  never came back to ask if we needed refills on our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> .....VERY LIMITED  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END> .  Don't GO...Don't believe all the HYPE that  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:O_Experience> great <END> !!!!!. If you go, you'll regret  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ....
When  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  comes to  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  I think  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the best in Vegas! I will definitely be back for the  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> !
Very  <START:O_Experience> good <END> .  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  of those places where you just can't decide what to get cause  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  all looks  <START:O_Experience> good <END> . The fondue is a must. I would go back for that alone. Also me got the beff belly BLT. Awsome!  And the lamburger. We will be back.
Maybe the best  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  I've ever had. The Bruges  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was a small bit of braised short  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  with Gouda on an excellent sourdough ish brioche. The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was juicy and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and nothing short of perfect. Poutin was too salty for me, but replaced them with  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  fries which were  <START:O_Experience> great <END> !
Jessie B. and I had decided to go to  <START:Food> lunch <END>  by where  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  worked. When  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  suggested  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  I was all in. Goyemon was  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  much fun. We ended up snagging the last two  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  at the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . (Score)  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  even have convenient purse hooks under the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . We both  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the AYCE  <START:Food> lunch <END>  ($21.95).  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a huge  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Jessie luckily had been  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  before  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  some of  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> favs <END>  and I picked some that sounded  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  to me. I really enjoyed the fact you could  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  really gives you an opportunity to try lots of different  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . Some of my favorites were the Sexy Girl, Lemon  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> , Pixie  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END> . I could go on forever, 'cause the truth is everything was  <START:O_Experience> good <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were very attentive and never let my  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  glass get empty.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also thanked us several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  for coming in. I can not  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back again. I've been dreaming about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  ever since! Mmmmm Goyemon!
Being a bit of a long walk from my  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  uptown I had never really even thought of checking  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  out till now.  I'm glad I finally made the trek.  Tucked away in Brevard Court, which might I say, is really a cool little niche of uptown, Valhalla is a nice addition.  Exposed brick  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  with the majority of the  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  being the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  gives  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  a nice  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>  pub feel.  Combine that with the  <START:Food> food <END>  and you've got a pretty decent  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to grab a pint and a  <START:O_Experience> good <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> .I enjoyed the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  and side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  when I went but I really want to go back and try some of the other  <START:Food> dishes <END> , specifically some of the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> items <END> .  Speaking of the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> items <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:Service> serve <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  all  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  long.   <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is non existent I'm pretty sure, you'll have to find street  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  or a lot or a  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  deck nearby.
Before I begin my review, I would first like to state the most negative part of Crepe Expectations: The fact I live in  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>  County, CA and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is all the way in Henderson, NV.  That is a real bummer to me now that I have tried  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  out.My wife and a couple of friends visited Lake Mead over the weekend and didn't want to suffer the consequences of  <START:F_FI_Price> 10 <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END>  breaks on the way home by eating the  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END> 's  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END> .   <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  what did I do?  I fired up Siri on my iPhone and asked  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  where I can eat something  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  as we strolled through Henderson.  Crepe Expectations  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  the recommended  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  with its  <START:F_FI_Size> massive <END>  amounts of positive reviews  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  we said screw  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , lets try  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  out.Upon driving up, the store looks pretty timid and small - but was quite busy and thriving on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was pretty inviting.  When you walk through the door  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  reminds you of a very classy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  type of  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  with most of the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  packed with couples and  <START:A_Env_Type> families <END> , and overall just a  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> .When walking up to the counter the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> , Lou, was smiling ear to ear.   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  of the most enthusiastic business  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  I have ever met, you could tell he  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> cares <END>  about his customers and has a lot of passion for what he does.  He took the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to explain various  <START:Food> items <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  in  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  detail, and was very well-spoken and articulated every detail of the  <START:Food> dish <END>  he was explaining.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was just  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  refreshing to see someone that stoked about what  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do and how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  run their business- you don't see that too often around my neck of the woods unfortunately. Anyway, my wife and I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:S_OpenHours> sunday <END>  Morning  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  and my friends  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  some other Crepe's that I do not recall.  We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  some Mimosa's which  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a huge  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  of various flavors.Then the  <START:Food> food <END>  came out - granted I have never even had a Crepe in my life... AMAZING.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  I can't even describe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  My  <START:Food> dish <END>  I had them add Serrano  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> diced <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ham <END>  - I couldn't believe how  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> .  We requested some hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and Lou recommended their house  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> .. best idea ever.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  awesome,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was better than most authentic Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> !  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was perfect, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was prompt and courteous, and the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  himself is  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  to make sure everything comes out well and to your liking.  I felt like I was in his own dining  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  and a guest of Lou & his wife's house and left wanting to come back again, but unfortunately that won't be able to happen until our next Lake Mead trip.. next year :(
Was wanting some  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  Vietnamese  <START:Food> food <END>  near my work,  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  I found  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was AWESOME. Best  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  and spring  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  I ever had in my entire life.  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  much flavar in the  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> . I could actually  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , as the crispy wrapper was very  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't all dough. Can't remember the name of my  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:Food> dish <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was #43. Fried  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  with all kinds of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  ball,  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> , sumari,  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> squid <END>  (octopus?) on  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> not greasy <END>  at all. WOW .. that's all I can say. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was very clean and I could tell  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was recently remodeled. I give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  four starts instead of 5 only because their English was  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  poor,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was really hard to communicate about to-go  <START:F_FI_Quality> boxes <END> ,  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> , etc. Nobody comes to leave a  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> , but we finally realized that others were going up to the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END> . I will definitely be back  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , likely again and again.
Stopped in again last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> .  Quick  <START:Service> service <END> !
Saw the sign for Phò and Vietnamese  <START:Food> food <END>  and had high hopes.  First warning that  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  would be disappointing came from the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ,  which was in French, English and Chinese; no Vietnamese. Second warning also came from the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , which contains sections for Vietnamese, Singaporean,  Malay and Chinese  <START:Food> food <END> .  Third warning was from the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ,  who were speaking Chinese amongst themselves.Despite the name,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a generic "Asian"  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ,  not a phò restaurent.But we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  we were looking to eat; Phò and a vermicelli  <START:Food> dish <END> .The  <START:Food> food <END>  was terrible. Watered down  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Weakly marinated grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . Wimpily  <START:F_FoodItem> pickled <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END>  and white radishes. The "Rare"  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  in the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ,  which was  <START:Food> anything <END>  but rare when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  reached the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , was tough and stuck together. I don't think  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was any  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  and the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END> .Nothing had any  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> ! Don't be afraid or too miserly to use  <START:F_Ingredients> spices <END>  and flavoring to your  <START:Food> dishes <END> !
I love  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and hope  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  will stay open. Why? We went on a Friday at  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  (11a.m.) and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was empty. No  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  came in during the course our  <START:Food> meal <END> .Anyway the  <START:Food> food <END>  is amazing. We tried the plaintine, pof-pof,  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  pie for  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> . <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all really  <START:O_Experience> good <END> . For the  <START:Food> entree <END> , i had the  <START:F_FoodItem> goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> . Man  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>   <START:O_Experience> good <END> . I want some  <START:W_Price> more <END>  now... Anyway i went to see a movie afterward.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  sucked. 2/5
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was awesome. The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is dangerous, as you can easily go crazy and forget that  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's all you can  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  afterwards! Very attentive  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't miss a beat. The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>  notch. Pace yourself and eat your favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  cuts first, in case you start running out of  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  towards the end.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is definitely a lot to choose from.Oh! And don't forget to have a Caipirinha!  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're quite refreshing!
 <START:O_Experience> great <END>  attention by the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , cozy  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  with some  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  by the fireplace.  Enjoyed our  <START:Food> meal <END> , but did not enjoy watching two  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  downing a fifth in the "secluded"  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area between  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  calls.  The charm of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with the acoustic  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  made for an overall pleasant  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> .  Ignore the cheesy led candle  <START:A_Decor> lights <END> .
Updating my review since  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  changed names a while back, and added a bunch of  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> .I love a  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  on a leafy residential street,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a unique kind of calm. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  yesterday were super friendly and kind - helping me carry my  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  when my hands were full of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was a chunk of  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  baguette full of herbed  <START:F_FoodItem> goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , bitter greens and pumpkin and sesame seeds - filling and  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and $5.  <START:W_Price> cash <END>  only, pretty cosy.
New York  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was perfect. Veal was OK.Seafood  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was as bad as  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  could be.  <START:Opinion> plus <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  give complimentary tap  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> , which smells  <START:Opinion> disgusting <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  even worse. Why don't you get some  <START:O_Experience> good <END>   <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  filtration system?
A favorite for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  or  <START:Food> lunch <END> , and fun to browse for unusual  <START:S_Gift> gifts <END> . The BBQ is terrific, but come hungry!!!
Don't be mistaken TQLA doesn't have Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  exactly.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is called "New Mexican"  <START:Food> food <END> . While  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  I wasn't expecting  <START:Restaurant> this <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  difference is that  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are a lot healthier  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  than a Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  were  <START:O_Experience> good <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent. If you are coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  you will be disappointed.
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> !! Loved the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  & the options for health  <START:Food> food <END>  & uniqueness!You can watch your  <START:Food> food <END>  being prepared & the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  is minimal for the amount of effort put into the  <START:Food> food <END> . I would recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in a heart beat!
No  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>  red  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> ?  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has gone down the tubes- like all  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  things in Vegas. I've been a  <START:F_Drinks> patron <END>  of Metro for a few decades and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  must've changed because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:Opinion> disgusting <END>  and unoriginal-  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  now  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  different. The Spring Street  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  stated  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  as an  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END> - but I never imagined  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 'd be green because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  never were before. When brought to the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> 's attention, even he wasn't aware because he went back to ask, I'm guessing the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> - or pretended to go ask- but returned and said  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  longer use red  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> ... What? A  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  no longer  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>  red  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> ? He wasn't even empathic to our disappointment. And to add to the bad  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , their own brand of draft  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  is gross. With all the other  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  options and specialty draft brews around, Metro has officially lost two customers due to the poor  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> .  <START:O_Experience> good <END>  riddance.
My husband really likes  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . A lot. I like the face that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  remember my name when I walk in. I love the Chicago hotdogs, not a  <START:Opinion> fan <END>  of the round  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  cut into squares.  That's just weird. But the  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END>  and  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  are awesome. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is excellent as well.
Really enjoy the  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Service> served <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at Wildflower  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  Company.  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  of our favorite places to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  at for our Saturday  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dates <END> .
 <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> , full of mexicain flavors, ver authentic.I had a  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> , and the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  is not very  <START:W_Price> expensive <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are definitely  <START:W_Price> more <END>  "high end"  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  places in Montreal, but ElRey Del Taco will suit your purist needs.
24  <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END>  was my last vegan stop during a recent trip to Arizona.  I was hoping to try  <START:F_FI_Size> one <END>  of their weekly  <START:Food> lunch <END>  offerings, but arrived too early!  I settled for a couple of their  <START:Food> brunch <END>  options and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did not disappoint.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> carrot <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  and Arizona Bowl.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  were a  <START:O_Experience> great <END>  - fluffy with chunks of  <START:F_Ingredients> carrot <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> pumpkin seeds <END> .  I also had a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  with them and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was really  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END>  and had a  <START:O_Experience> great <END>   <START:Food> texture <END> .  The Arizona Bowl was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  - a mix of  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END> , soyrizo,  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> , and avocado.  I think that my bowl was missing the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was still filling and really  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  I also tried a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of almond  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> , which was yummy as well.  I was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  the  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  after Easter (for which  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END> )  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  the baked goods and  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  case was empty,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were out of maple syrup, and my bowl seemed to lack a few components.  I understand that  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  after a holiday, but really wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a bit  <START:W_Price> more <END>  to offer.  I will definitely return the next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm in Arizona with the hopes of trying out  <START:W_Price> more <END>  of their offerings!
Just opened today in downtown summerlin. Went for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  w a colleague.  <START:Food> food <END>  was as expected from a CPK and the set up of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was really nice.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the 3rd  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in the new shopping area that I've been to on opening  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is always a little over zealous and nervous on the first  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  but jeez, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  today was annoying as hell. First,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were probably as many people in  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  as  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were eating. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  interrupted us frequently, and was heavily pushing from the start a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  we had no interest in for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . My  <START:Food> food <END>  was almost taken out of my hand while I was still eating. I was asked probably  <START:F_FI_Price> 10 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  in  <START:F_FI_Price> 10 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  if I was done or wanted a to go  <START:F_FI_Quality> box <END>  from about  <START:F_FI_Price> 6 <END>  different staffers. Also was additionally asked the same over and over for  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  refills after we said no. I'm excited about the new  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  but just let people eat and enjoy the  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> ! We were patient and understanding for a while but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  got to be too much  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END>  we left and walked around for a bit. I'll come back but I hope the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  will be  <START:W_Price> more <END>  acclimated and  <START:Opinion> less <END>  pressured to sell and  <START:Service> serve <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's obviously coming from the  <START:S_Staff> management <END>  but  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a  <START:Opinion> fine <END>   <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  between being helpful and ruining the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .I'd suggest going  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to check  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out but maybe after  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 've been in business a month or  <START:F_FI_Quality> so <END> .
