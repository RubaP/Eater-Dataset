Thai  <START:Food> food <END>  is pretty easy to do well. Unfortunately thai lahna cuts a lot of corners and serves mediocre  <START:Food> food <END> . It's a neat  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>   <START:A_Environment> space <END>  with cool  <START:A_Decor> decorations <END>  but it's nowhere near the  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END>  thai  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can get in the area  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  satay was ok, but the peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> runny and gross <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  lahb (I normally see it called " <START:F_FoodItem> larb <END> ") didn't have nearly enough  <START:F_FI_Taste> citrus <END>  and I could feel granules of  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  powder on my tongue. Green  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was underwhelming in  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and lacked any interesting tasty veggiesIf a friend made  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  for me, I'd be like  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  job, keep working at it! Unfortunately  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , so it gets 2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> 
I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on a recommendation on how  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  is. I was disappointed with the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  that had  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> brown wilted <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  that  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  and the Sausage  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was just OK. Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I will try the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  only.....that's if I make it back.
Stopped in to grab a  <START:S_Del_Time> quick <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  and was very happy with what we got!! The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> ,  the  <START:F_FoodItem> bagels <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Size> huge <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Size> plenty <END>  of cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . Excellent! !
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  joint is open 24 hours!!!  Sold. I had the  <START:Food>   pho   dac biet <END> , and it was super  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> clear <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was, surprisingly,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> very tender <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> firm <END>  and  <START:Food> everything <END>  was just  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  I would normally  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem>   pho   thai <END>  rather than  <START:Food>   pho   dac biet <END> , but I was feeling like a fatty and went ahead with it.  The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> patient <END>  so that's always a plus.  The  <START:Service> facility <END>  was CLEAN!!  Now, that's something  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  don't see very often in  <START:F_FoodItem> pho <END>   <START:A_Places> joints <END> .I also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> che ba mau <END>  (three-color  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ) and it was just okay.  It was in a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  and I was charged $3.50.  Kinda pricey, but, meh, I've had  <START:F_FoodItem> better <END> .  I took my parents  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  (who grew up in Vietnam and are self-proclaimed  <START:F_FoodItem> pho <END>  connoisseurs) and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  really liked the  <START:Food> food <END> .  Score!  I pat myself in the back. The only downside was that it's a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>   <START:W_Price> pricier <END>  (by $1 or $2) than what my family and I were used to paying compared to  <START:F_FoodItem> pho <END>  in LA .  A couple dollars may not seem as much, but it'll add up.  That aside, come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and enjoy the  <START:F_FoodItem> pho <END> .
1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  for Komol? Absolutely. Komol's  <START:Food> food <END>  is usually really  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> , so much so that it's been on my weekly  <START:Food> lunch <END>  rotation for almost 2 years. But no matter how  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  their  <START:Food> food <END>  is, if  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can't get  <START:Service> service <END>  nothing else matters. Less than an hour ago as I write  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  and for the 2nd  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  recently I've walked out without getting my  <START:Food> food <END> . If the  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot is  <START:A_Environment> packed <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  always seems to suffer. Thursdays in particular seem to be the worst. While LOS across the  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot is a lot  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:W_Price> expensive <END>  and overrated in my opinion, at least I can get something to eat  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . When the Komol  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  knows  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  by name, and even knows your favorite  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  still screw it up...yeah, that's certainly 1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:Worthiness> worthy <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is just like a hospital  <START:Restaurant> cafeteria <END> . lots of  <START:A_Furniture> boothes <END> , very clean but It's an all- <START:S_Staff> you <END> -can EAT  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END> . so What do  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  expect? Very BLAH!! Really NO  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  to speak of just a busboyAND  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  REFILL PEOPLE WHO WERE no WHERE TO BE FOUND. <START:S_Staff> busboy <END>  spent the entire  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we were  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> flirting <END>  with other male patrons and NOT clearing  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . WE Had NO Expectations BUT it was still LOUSYNOT very many selections. 4  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END> -butter  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END> , <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END> , <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  vegetable(the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was ground  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ) 3 types of  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> - <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  caesar- <START:F_FoodItem> mixed   greens   <END>  and a blueberry  <START:F_Dessert> mango <END>  special I tried. The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END>  were OK -filling anyways NOT much on the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  and 6 different  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END> -type  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and about 20  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  mix  <START:Food> items <END>  for your  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  BUT not anything EXTRAordinary. Pretty Awful ReallyNOT SO SOOUPAH!! Where to START?? If  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  need a  <START:S_Del_Time> quick <END>  fill and ONLY have $5 in your pocket-Give it a try-otherwise go try  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> 's,Chop Stix or Romano's Macaroni Grill all in the same shopping center. For Value it is a  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  deal BUT for  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  NOT!!ONLY THING GOING  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  IS IT'S CHEAPER THAN A HAPPY  <START:Food> meal <END>  @ $3.95 FOR  <START:Food> lunch <END> 
I've lived nearby it before and had never gone in, I had heard  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> things <END>  from people who's  <START:Food> food <END>  opinions I trusted and decided that today is the  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> . Their  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  were  <START:F_Drinks> great <END> , something  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  could enjoy and  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were no  <START:A_Decor> pictures <END>  of the  <START:Food> entrees <END>  so I was a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>  worried but when my  <START:Food> food <END>  arrived it was lovely,  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  pad Thai awesomeness.  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  at our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  cleaned their  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  (except for me because,  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  know, I'm a dainty flower and  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> portions <END>  for me means doggie bag left overs for the boyfriend.) Their Thai  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  was perfect, it made me smile and I had to use some self control instead of just chugging the whole glass. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> authentic <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and   <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and their  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  make it even  <START:F_FoodItem> better <END> . Now I know where to go when my Thai  <START:Food> food <END>  cravings hit again. And the name of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is fun to say...
Just gone done with a birthday  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for my cousin. I will say what we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  (Margherita  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ) was very  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> , but others at our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  were disappointed with what  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> mozzarella <END>  was some of the  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END>  I've ever had.My issue is with the  <START:Service> service <END> .  <START:Food> dinner <END>  was at 7. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> , Victoria, failed to  <START:F_FI_Quality> clear <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  from the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , had to make it a point that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't  <START:Offers> offer <END>  free birthday  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  because " <START:S_Staff> they <END>  get 2 to 4 birthdays a  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> ." That's fine, but I'm sure every birthday  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  is dropping $200 or  <START:W_Price> more <END>  on  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  &  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can't give out a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  free birthday  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ?The worst part of the  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  was  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  FORTY-FIVE  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for her to tally 5 separate checks for 14 people. What should have been an enjoyable 1.5  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  hour  <START:Food> dinner <END>  turned into a 2.5 hour nightmare with some of the worst  <START:Service> service <END>  I've ever received. Even the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  was sitting at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  with a glass of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  on his laptop and  <START:S_Staff> ignoring <END>  the 3 birthday  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  had.In fact, getting the check took so long that by the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we left we were hungry again, so we stopped off at  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  Express & got  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:Service> service <END> !
Dear Bouncers at Four Peaks,So many people "judge a book by its cover"--and for  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  reason--the "cover" is the first impression that one gets of a business. At Four Peaks,  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  make for a  <START:A_OutsideView> terrible <END>  "cover" and I will not return until your attitude improves. Get off your high peaks. Until then, I'm off to buy a 40 of Bud  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  at Circle K.Kind regards,Former Customer
 <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can't find  <START:F_FoodItem> better <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  anywhere. The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  is also  <START:F_Drinks> great <END> , and I'm not a  <START:F_FI_Size> huge <END>  fan of  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> . I LOVE their  <START:F_FoodItem> peach ale <END> . The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are terrific and their fries are  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . No  <START:A_Env_AC> air conditioning <END> , just a  swamp  <START:A_Env_AC> cooler <END>  so while  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  are fine to go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  on a summer  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> , just make sure  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  deep inside the  <START:Ambience> building <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END> .  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . ROX! I'll never go back to Subway or Jimmy John's again! I had The Kind (Turkey,  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END> , Swiss n  <START:F_Ingredients> shrooms <END> ) on  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> veggies <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> mayo <END>  and BOY was it phenomenal! My husband got the AK-47 (French Dip with red  <START:F_Ingredients> onions <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> shrooms <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> provolone <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> mayo <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> ) on  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and that did not disappoint either.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  also has  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> snacks <END> ! I sampled a ball of  <START:F_FoodItem> mashmallow <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> melted <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> fruity pebbles <END>  and it truly hit the  <START:A_Places> spot <END> ! I am looking forward to making  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  my  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  every Sat while I do my laundry (24 hr laundry mat in same plaza) and am going to enjoy tasting  <START:Food> everything <END>  on their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are open  <START:S_Del_Time> late <END>  AND  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END> !If  <START:S_Staff> you <END> 're a toasted Sammy lover like me,  <START:S_Staff> you <END> 'll LOVE  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  TOO! CHECK IT OUT!
Came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  after the longest plane ride ever from Charlotte. Rode around and discovered Bahama Breeze. Me and my friend figured that since the  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot was full at 2pm on a Friday afternoon...the  <START:Food> food <END>  must be pretty  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> . We decided to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  our  <START:Food> food <END>  To-Go and the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> very   helpful   <END>  offering some recommendations. We  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and we sit around chatting and people watching. After 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> , our  <START:Food> food <END>  is ready!I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Oak Grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> tomato <END>  and goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  on Ciabatta  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ....AMAZING! The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was tender and juicy and well  <START:Offers> seasoned <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was slightly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> melted <END>  and the  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> tomato <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and tasty! I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> tomato <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> basil <END>  and balsamic vinegarette  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  on the side. I ate that on the way back to the resort so fast..I couldnt really tell  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  how it  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> ...so I assume it was  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> . After the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and and  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cold <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , I slept for hours :) Bahama Breeze??  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  have a satisfied customer  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ! Now...build a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Virginia/DC area please!!
Before leaving my review I want to give my humble opinion on all the negative reviews on  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  connection is part o the  <START:Food> food <END>  court at the mall, so it is important to reset expectations to the right levels when  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  are getting value for your money.Every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I come to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  stand, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  looks  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and appealing (except for the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ...the presentation is a bit dry for my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> ), including the free samples. Just like with places like Panda Express or Ichiban,  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  pick  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  or  <START:F_Ingredients> veggies <END>  and then your  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END> .Every  <START:Food> dish <END>   <START:S_Staff> you <END>  get  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , as hinted by the name, and every single one is tasty.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have  <START:F_Drinks> bourbon <END> , blackened, sweet and sour, and stewed  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  with a  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  kick.  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can get  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and two  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  for $7 minus discount if  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  work a the mall, making it a  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to come have  <START:Food> lunch <END> .Like a  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  friend of mine said... "At the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  connection  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  get  <START:F_FI_Size> plenty <END>  of protein with one  <START:F_FoodItem> carb <END>  or  <START:F_Ingredients> veggies <END>  for around $7. What else can  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  ask for?"
 <START:F_Ingredients> best <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  I've eaten. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was spotty. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is in a real need for a makeover.
Impeccable  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END> . Just one of those places where  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  KNOW  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  will be  <START:Service> treated <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>  notch. It is pricey but I still would have expected our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  to inform us when  <START:Food> items <END>  are extra like Caesar  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  instead of garden  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> anchovies <END>  on the Caesar were an extra $2.
I will say one thing about Barcelona. It is spacious, so for all the claustrophobic people out  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> you <END> 'll definitely not feel like a sardine in a tin can. I love how  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  have your options open - if  <START:S_Staff> you <END> 'd like to feel the sultry summer breeze, or lack of,  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can sit  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> , or if  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  are freezing  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can go to the  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:Ambience> building <END> , and dance your drunk ass off. Yes, the live band's slightly cheesy, but when  <START:S_Staff> you <END> 're inebriated, who cares? Caution, for cougar lovers,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are a lot prowling around,  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  to sink their claws in young  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . I've never had the opportunity to eat  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , so I can't say anything in regards to  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is definitely not for people who are going out, expecting to meet a ton of young people, and surround yourself with recent college graduates. Yes,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is diversity. I've seen young to extremely  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> . I've met my share of extremely weird characters, like  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  man who was trying to pull girls from the dance  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  or the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , to share the VIP  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  with his son who was celebrating his birthday. It sort of felt like  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was trying to pimp us out to his son, but that's a different story all together. Barcelona's is a cougar's den, and the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  aren't satisfactory for the wallet, but I do emphasize how I love the spaciousness of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> ! I suppose that's the only reason I enjoy it, anyway. I usually relax  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> , and the dancing side of me doesn't come into action  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . With the live band, it's hard to shake my moneymaker, anyway.
Judging by apperances,  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  would think  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is pretentious, trendy, and  <START:W_Price> expensive <END> . So it kind of is. But it's also a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that makes their  <START:F_Drinks> martinis <END>  stong and filled to the brim ( <START:S_Staff> you <END>  know when  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  put liquid into a container and it gets a "dome effect" when it's about to spill over? that's how full  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  make them) serves buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> crisscut fries <END>  in a basket for $7, all in an open, airy envoronment that is truly unique in it's design and has won accolades in the architectural world. So  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  really get your money's  <START:W_Price> worth <END> .  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  are  <START:O_Reservation> not accepted <END> , so the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  can be annoying, but it's quickly forgotten as it's a prime  <START:A_Places> spot <END>  for people watching while  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  hang out at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . I've come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on dates and also for a girls  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  out and each  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I love AZ88 a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END> .
The  <START:A_Environment> space <END>  is really cool and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> , but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was less then impressive. I think the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  can be a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END>  creative and  <START:F_FoodItem> better <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  for a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> this <END> . Its reminiscent of  <START:Restaurant> cafeteria <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  though.
I really like  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  because it had  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  wasn't as much of a selection compared to places like crave at mirage, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  all  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  for me.  I think the  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is also at a  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:W_Price> price <END>  around 18 bucks for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and 23 bucks for  <START:Food> dinner <END> ( <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:W_Price> expensive <END>  on weekends).   <START:F_Ingredients> things <END>  that i like: Prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END> , mongolian  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs, etc.  Check it out, its the  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END>   <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  on the  <START:F_FI_Size> strip <END>  hands down.
Wonderful  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  pot pie is a must!
I visited Cantina 1511 for a Saturday  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the enchiladas de Dennis.  Although the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  was warm and inviting it did not wow the palate.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  seems to be very 'visitor  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> '.  It is as one would expect for TexMex, not a  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>  but also not bold or daring in its  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  selection or  <START:F_Ingredients> spices <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was adequate as it was not very busy around 1 PM on a Saturday. We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  in the front of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  closest to the road.  I'm not sure if the  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  next to us just had  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  lungs with voices that carried or if the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  could have used some sound barriers because I could hear their conversation  <START:F_FoodItem> better <END>  than our own!
Went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on our trip due to reviews.  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> , not amazing, but  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END>  for Italian  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  totally forgot about us after we got our  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  at least 40  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  just to get the check. Also think I got  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Healthy> poisoning <END>  from  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  truffle gnocchi. Disappointed to say the least.
Consistently a  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> hummus <END> , always a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of new  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END> .
 <START:Service> service <END>  is always  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is much smaller than the one in Henderson.   <START:Food> food <END>  on a 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  scale: <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  4.5 StarThey give  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  8  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  pieces, not too bready like L&L.

The  <START:Service> service <END>  is exceptional!!   We enjoyed the house  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> .  Would return and try some new  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END> .  The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is beautiful.
 <START:F_FI_Taste> horrible <END> !!!! I do not know how  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  stays in business... Bland! No  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  at all and over  <START:W_Price> priced <END> ! I'm from Houston so my Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  standards are high.  I will NEVER come back to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  :(
Agree with Jeremy A. -  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  value. Heck, I was happy thinking of the  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  way:"Whoa, $25 is a  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  deal for all  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can eat  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END> !"(And if  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  just do that,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  will probably lose money on  <START:S_Staff> you <END> !)Random thoughts.- The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is pretty lame. It clearly comes out of a machine, gross. The  <START:F_FoodItem> temaki <END>  is OK but like all  <START:F_FoodItem> temaki <END>  it is 99%  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and 1%  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> .-  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END> . It is arguably  <START:F_FoodItem> better <END>  than the stuff at the Bellagio, which I found to be dry and flavorless.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also have actual (non- <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> creamy <END> )  <START:F_Ingredients> horseradish <END> , which I appreciate deeply.-  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> gelato <END>  - but the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  was giving  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  the evil eye, I don't know why. I won't hold it against the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .- And of  <START:F_FoodItem> course <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  / raw  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  :)I'd love to come back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm in Vegas.
My favorite Thai  <START:A_Places> spot <END>  in Vegas! Hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> mom and pop <END> . If  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  are looking for some real  <START:F_FoodItem> authentic <END>  Thai  <START:Food> food <END> , don't go to the fancy Thai  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  on the  <START:F_FI_Size> strip <END>  and  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END>  when  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can get the real thing for a fair  <START:W_Price> price <END>  on Flamingo(and newer  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  on Sahara). I usually  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the Tom yum  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , papaya  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> pad seew <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  at every Thai  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I try. All very  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>  at Archie's. <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  levels from 1-10. 1 being  <START:F_FI_Taste> mild <END>  and 10 being the most  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  all 6 on the  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END> . I love  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , meaning I love  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapenos <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> habanero <END> , Thai  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> peppers <END> . 6 was a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>  too  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  for me, but after a few  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END> , I got used to it. I think 5 would be perfect. At least  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can add  <START:W_Price> more <END>  of your own  <START:F_Ingredients> peppers <END>  to  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . I can't even imagine how  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  a 10 would be. I can imagine level 10 being on "man vs  <START:Food> food <END> ".The Thai  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> iced <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> ,  <START:Service> served <END>  in a  <START:F_FI_Size> huge <END>  glass.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do put tons of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END> , so if  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  would like  <START:W_Price> more <END>  liquid then  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END> , I'd tell them to lay off the  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END> . I personally like it with a lot of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  though. The thai  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> iced <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  also neutralizes the  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  hotness in your mouth.  The only negative comment I have about archi's is the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END> . It's not very clean and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were no paper towels or extra toilet paper.Go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for real  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  Thai.
 <START:Food> food <END>  overall was  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  (Tofu  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , etc.).   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  wasn't really any  <START:Food> dish <END>  I could knock.   <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  was still pretty  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END> .  The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> pretty   helpful   <END>  in helping me pick something  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  that I've never had before.  Hell, I even think the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is bottled, not tap!
The wife and I were out running errands and it was getting  <START:S_Del_Time> late <END>  so we decided to stop by Ricardo's because it had been a while since our last visit. It was after 9pm, so we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  in the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area, which was fine because it was pretty chill for a Friday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . We both hadn't eaten since  <START:Food> lunch <END> , so we were excited for the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  are pretty fantastic,  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and not too salty. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> mild <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  was like  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cold <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> tomato <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , but the  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  had nice full  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> , though could have been  <START:F_FI_Taste> chunkier <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  dip  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  fat, and that is kind of a turn off for me. My wife had the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  (minus the  <START:F_Ingredients> mushrooms <END> ) which  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  very  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> . I had a  <START:F_FoodItem> chile <END>  relleno and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>  combo  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . The Relleno was decent, but the  <START:F_FoodItem> chile <END>  was super  <START:F_FI_Taste> mild <END>  and not a lot of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>  was very  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> , and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was just right, not too overpowering. I also got a Pacifico for $4.25 which wasn't too  <START:F_FI_Taste> horrible <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Size> portions <END>  are a bit smaller than other Mexican places (the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  filled me up, but I had no leftovers which isn't typical for me), and the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are a bit high, but if  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  have a  hankering for some  <START:S_Del_Time> late <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  eats that won't give  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  a  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  of a gut bomb as say Roberto's (which I love, so no trash talk  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ),  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:S_Staff> you <END> . It is also not a bad  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for an everyday  <START:Food> dinner <END>  either!
As I always do at every  <START:Restaurant> steakhouse <END> , is start with the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bisque <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END>  was awesome! But no  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> ! And had some sort of  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  textured  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  balls in it! Lose that, and put some  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  in it, and it would be  <START:F_Drinks> great <END> !!!Had the 8oz  <START:F_FoodItem> filet oscar <END> ,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to perfection!  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:Service> service <END> !
4 and a  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> kebobs <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  pita  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .
Wonderful  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  Chinese  <START:Food> food <END> !  Loved the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  towels  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  brought  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  between courses.  The  <START:F_FI_Size> portions <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  enough that our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  of 7 all shared.  To end the  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:S_Staff> you <END>  are given a fortune  <START:F_Dessert> cookie <END>  and a bailey's &  <START:F_Drinks> milk shooter <END> -yum! I'd definitely recommend it!
Do as the locals do. That's what brought us to Winchell's for  <START:Food> dinner <END> . It has the usual pub fare --  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , and greasy  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> . And  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did it all well... just enough to add it to my "could go to again" list. And I think that's an important list to be on. What really put  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  on the map and pleasantly surprised me was the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  -- it was tender and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END> , not the rough and stringy  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  I usually have at pub/brewery/ <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  type places.It's totally out of the way and off the  <START:F_FI_Size> strip <END>  --  <START:W_Price> more <END>  for locals than tourists, but if  <START:S_Staff> you <END> 're looking for some greasy  <START:Food> food <END>  and want to avoid the  <START:A_Env_Type> crowds <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  option to consider.
Went on a Saturday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  to have a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and some  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  with friends while attending a conference across the street at the Westin.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were out of  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , and oddly sat us upstairs by ourselves when  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Size> plenty <END>  of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  available downstairs. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent and decently  <START:W_Price> priced <END> . Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was much  <START:S_Stf_Appearance> too casual <END> , though -  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  dropped the F-bomb a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and complained about her coworker being pregnant. We watched her turn a  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> -thermos upside down to get the last few drops out before  <START:S_Delivery> delivering <END>  it to us. The  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  wasn't even warm, let alone  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END> .
The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> , Sherry is the nicest woman on the planet.  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  may get a hug from her, even if  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  are meeting her for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . By moving my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  to accommodate some diners next to me, I got mad hugs. And a nice chat about our rescue dogs at home- always a  <START:F_FI_Size> huge <END>  fan of that. The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is always  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> super laid back <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  as well and seem to go above and beyond to be real and chat......so ok, on with the  <START:Food> food <END> .So SC may be a tad  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END> , but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> brunch <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END>  is always solid and always  <START:F_FI_Size> chock full <END>  of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> steamed <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> veggies <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do a really  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soy latte <END>  as well-  <START:Service> served <END>  in these cool, square mugs. Beware- the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  gets  <START:A_Environment> packed <END>  during  <START:F_FoodItem> brunch <END> !  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area where  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can sit and  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , so I suggest bringing a laptop with  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  while  <START:S_Staff> you <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .
 <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  today. We are disappointed with the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> over done <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> breadsticks <END> . :( The past few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  we have been to Olive Garden, the  <START:F_FoodItem> breadsticks <END>  are  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> dry and hard <END> ! Bring back  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> soft <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> breadsticks <END> , or I'm done.
Went for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  morning and wish I had gone before.  I had the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> smoked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> scrambled eggs <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were terrific.  The  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> sizes <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Size> huge <END>  and well  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the money.
What a way to make your  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  for only 5 bucks!!   <START:S_Staff> you <END>  have the  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  of all  <START:S_Menu> kinds <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  plus killer  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  too!!  If  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  need a  <START:S_Del_Time> quick <END>  fix or want to sneek  <START:Food> food <END>  into the movies stop by  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:S_Staff> you <END>  will not be disappointed!  Turkey pastrimi, buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and gyro  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  are to die for.  Just grab a sharpe. write your name on the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>  of the bag and check off the  <START:F_Ingredients> things <END>   <START:S_Staff> you <END>  want on the  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END> ..  that simple - well for some...  Its hard for me to pick what I want.
For the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END> ...the  <START:Food> food <END>  was not  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it. Our group of 4  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  3 different  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  (the  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  pot pie), a common  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  (calamari) and individual starters. Before I move on, I need to say that the  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  - my  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  crib is about the  <START:Food> food <END> . Calamari was decent, but  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  could get  <START:F_FoodItem> better <END>  at any local  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> gumbo <END>  to start with and I must say that I was really disappointed. After watching Emeril's  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  - I expected his recipes to be a lot  <START:F_FoodItem> better <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> gumbo <END>  was gritty by design,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> mushy <END>  and didnt really give  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . After eating  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  in a couple of  <START:A_Places> joints <END>  in New Orleans, I can say that  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  definately wasn't up to the mark. We all  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  each other's  <START:Food> food <END>  and I have to say that the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  pot pie was the pick of the lot followed by the  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> . For God's sake don't get the  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> .
Noticed  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  after a  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at Pita Jungle. I have a new found love for  <START:F_FoodItem> gelato <END>  so I decided to check it out.The  <START:S_Staff> gentleman <END>  working the counter must have been an  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  as  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  commented on his wife making all the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> . Anytime an  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  is run by an  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  it tends to be  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:Service> service <END> . Yay  <START:Restaurant> mom and pop <END>  places! Thank  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  for forging ahead in these uncertain  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> .So  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> gelato <END> .. I've learned that if something seems super weird/crazy on a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  that its always  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  a try. If it was  <START:F_FI_Taste> horrible <END>  its very unlikely it would be on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .. unless it was brand new. <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  Sampled: <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END> :The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  told me I wouldn't be sorry for trying it and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was right. The  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> creamy <END> /fatty  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> /texture of the  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>  was a  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  pairing.  <START:F_FoodItem> gelato <END>  is much  <START:F_FI_Healthy> lower in fat <END>  then  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream so the added fat from the  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>  didn't make it overly heavy. It was very  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> smooth <END> ,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> creamy <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> refreshing <END> . <START:F_FoodItem> peanut butter <END> :By now those poor souls who actually read my novel like reviews know my love for  <START:F_FoodItem> peanut butter <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  had an amazingly strong peanut  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and was made with real  <START:F_FoodItem> peanut butter <END> . I didn't ask which brand but I'm guessing it was not one filled with  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> . Was a very dark rich  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>  peanut  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  verses the  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  bomb type we usually get in baked goods/sweets.Strawberry(no  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  added):Had a nice strong strawberry  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  but was a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> overly sweet <END>  like most sucralose type products. <START:F_Dessert> mango <END> :Super strong  <START:F_Dessert> mango <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no guessing what  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  were eating. Not sure how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  got  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  much  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  from a natural product but I don't believe  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  use any artificial flavoring.I ended up getting  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> peanut butter <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END> .. and no I didn't mix them.. that would be weird even for me :POne other cool thing I noticed was a  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had. The Costco  <START:F_FoodItem> peanut butter <END>  filled  <START:F_FoodItem> pretzels <END> . Imagine how tasty that would be with some  <START:F_FoodItem> peanut butter <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream or  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  chip  <START:F_Dessert> cookie <END>  dough  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream.. YUM!One thing  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had going that  <START:F_FoodItem> gelato <END>   <START:A_Places> spot <END>  and many of the others don't is the  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  selection.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were 5 or so different  <START:F_FI_Size> sizes <END>  and ALL  <START:F_FI_Size> sizes <END>  including the smallest could be mixed. Most have a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  and a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  and will only do a single  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  in the  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END> . I like that  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can get as much product as  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  want.. cuts down on waste and probable overeating.
Went to hear Bill Dutcher play (wonderful guitarist and entertainer).  First  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  visiting  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .I won't bore  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  with the details, but it will be our last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  visiting  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> !Poor  <START:Service> service <END> .  Way  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END> !   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  (at the end of a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cold <END>  and just wanted some comfort  <START:Food> food <END> ).  Was told that was the kids  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  (which I hadn't noticed) and would not make it for me as I was not a kid anymore.  I asked if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  could make it as an adult  <START:Food> dish <END>  and would be happy to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END> .  After much ado,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  finally agreed.   <START:Service> served <END>  it to me way  <START:S_Del_Time> late <END>  in the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and charged $4  <START:W_Price> more <END>  (that's okay I expected to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END>  and offered).The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was okay but our bill was over $80 (yes we had a few  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  too).If  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  want  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> .....go to Blue Wasabi,   <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  happy hours and much  <START:F_FoodItem> better <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END> .Sorry, cannot recommend going  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   :(
Well what do  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  say, it is always hopping,,,, <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> ... <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , obviously high  <START:Food> food <END>  turnover, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is usually  <START:A_Environment> packed <END> .  I personally don't see what the hype is ???? Fast, easy, casual..... <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:Service> service <END> ...it gets my vote.
Are  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  listening, LES INFIDELES satisfies with class and fervour!Evan b. is right on with his BYOB details, a total win win. We also dined on the  <START:F_FoodItem> escargot <END> , freakin' holy moly  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> ! I had the goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  brie crostini, never have I  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  such wonderful  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  than  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  summer in Montreal! MERCI! And the  <START:F_Ingredients> greens <END>  were  <START:A_Decor> dressed <END>  with, possibly, a  <START:F_Ingredients> champagne vinagrette <END> ?  A truly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> refreshing <END>   <START:Food> dish <END> . A  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  tenderloin in a  <START:F_Ingredients> balsamic reduction <END>  was heavenly and the  <START:F_FoodItem> cravettes <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to perfection. We too walked through Parc Lafontaine and Rue Rachel is lovely. A  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  for a pre- and post  <START:Food> dinner <END>  stroll. The entire  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END>  was a delightful  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . Make a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  and see for yourself.
With a grand selection and  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  can satisfy their personal  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  just can't go wrong at Vices et Versa! We sat  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> , which had a nice feel to it. My friends and I had a bunch of different  <START:F_FoodItem> degustation pairings <END>  that included white, blonde, and amber  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> , as well as  <START:F_Drinks> cider <END> !  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , my least favorite one being the ginger  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> . My friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  for herself, it was perfectly  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>  for a single eater and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  ( <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was nice enough to give me a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> !). The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was accommodating,  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> ,  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> , and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> helpful <END> . I was especially impressed when  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  told my friend that her  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  had accidentally been  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> overcooked <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burned <END>  a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END> , so  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were making her a brand new one. I commend and respect that very much because many places are  <START:W_Price> more <END>  interested in your wallet than in your satisfaction. It's a shame when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  about the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're pushing, Vices et Versa on the other hand does  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  and it shows.
I detest puns.  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  have no idea how much I do. I wanted to hate  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  when I heard the name and saw the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . However, our hotel  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  recommended it (also, it was one of the few places open on New Year's  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> ).I was wrong. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was outstanding and we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  promptly. The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were  <START:S_Del_Time> quick <END>  with our  <START:Food> food <END>  and even gave us some tips on how to get to where we wanted to sightsee in Montreal!I forget what it was called, but I had  <START:F_FoodItem> french toast <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> flambeed bananas <END> , brown  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> brandy <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> cinnamon <END>  and powder  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  on the side were incredible and the freshly squeezed orange  <START:F_Drinks> juice <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> . Possibly one of the  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END>   <START:Food> breakfasts <END>  I've ever had!If/when I return to Montreal I would definitely hit  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  up again.
 <START:F_FI_Size> huge <END>  dissapointment.  <START:Service> service <END>  was lousy. It seemed like the  <START:S_Staff> waitstaff <END>  was completely untrained. Since I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  parmesan, I felt like a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  let us know that " <START:S_Staff> chef <END> " didn't allow sides of  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  reccomended that my girlfried and I split the $19  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:Food> entree <END> . Well " <START:S_Staff> chef <END> " had no right to not allow sides of  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  based upon how the rest of his  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> overcooked <END>  to the point that it  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  burnt even under a layer of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  wasn't even the worst part. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  parmesan was covered in so much  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  that not only could I not finish it, but it  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  than the actual  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  did. Not impressed conisidering the amount of money I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END> .
I'm new to the area, and have been looking for the  <START:A_Places> perfect   spot   <END>  to call my own since I moved  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Well, that  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has turned out to be Jackalope Jacks and I'm pretty excited about it. I have tried many  <START:F_Ingredients> things <END>  off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  on our weekly visit, and I have yet to be dissapointed.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  add something to  <START:Food> everything <END> , that I'm just assuming is canned  <START:F_FI_Taste> deliciousness <END> , and that's just fine by me. I knew  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for me, when we walked up and people had their pups sitting by their side on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have the deck area with the fans that blow mist, and that's pretty  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  on a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> , it's like my own personal sprinkler, and if I closed my eyes long enough, I'd be wisked away to  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>  of my childhood with the sprinkler spraying on me. Ah, memories... Oh..  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END> , I'm getting off track  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ...But I love  <START:Food> everything <END>  about Jacks, from the ski ball, to the chalkboard  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathrooms <END> , to the selection of  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END> . I will be  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for Karaoke one  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and I'm sure I'll make lots of new friends who will feel the same way about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  awesome  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  :P
Historically M & S has been a stable  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  It has always been a reliable  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go for  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  The Charlotte  <START:A_Places> spot <END>  does not disappoint.
One of the Viet  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  we hit up a lot.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  are very generous and  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> .  The spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are also  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> .  Had a few different broken  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  and had no complaints thus far.  Not too many  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:S_Menu> choices <END> , but a pretty  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:A_Places> spot <END>  if  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  have that  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:O_Experience> craving <END> .  Also, next to  <START:A_Places> market <END>  and  <START:A_Places> boba spots <END> ...that was a plus.
Why did I  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  so long to try  <START:Restaurant> this <END> !  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is no typical  <START:F_FoodItem> torta <END>  joint!   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has a plethora (do I get extra points for using  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  word?) of  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastiness <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> !  Tortas,  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream, all these other  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:S_Menu> choices <END> ...AND....a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>   <START:A_Places> bakery <END> ! All of their  <START:F_Drinks> agua frescas <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Taste> amazingly tasty <END> ...not too sweet at all!  I had  <START:F_Drinks> agua limon <END>  and I wanted  <START:W_Price> more <END> !  Very clean and very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:Service> service <END> !   <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and just  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>  all around!
If  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  get a chance to check  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  out it is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it.  It is very  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  and at  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>   <START:S_Staff> you <END>  feel a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>  cramped but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_Drinks> great <END> ! My personal favorite at  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is the Sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  Fries.    <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> candy <END> !  I usually  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the Turkey  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with a Whole Wheat bun.  Gotta love  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .   At Red Rock Casino, it is a waaaaaays from anything  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  might be familiar with in Las Vegas but it is one of the  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END>  sit-down  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:A_Places> joints <END>   <START:S_Staff> you <END> 'll find.
 <START:Food> food <END>  is always  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  I love going  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  during  <START:Food> lunch <END> . But just make sure  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  dint get Anthony as a  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  is rude bring  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  the wrong  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  and tell  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  "oh  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  ain't adventurist why didn't  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  eat it. "  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  didn't gives us a copy of receipt and was mad because of no tip!
I'm so confused. I came to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with a Groupon expecting myself a  <START:Food> lunch <END> .I pulled up to the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is not only a sign that said "Closed for renovation", but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was the name of another  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  painted on the  <START:A_Furniture> windows <END>  and on the billboard on the street.So did another  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  take over  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> ?
I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  with our family.   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  usually consists of myself, my husband, my 2-year- <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> , my 6-year- <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> , and my in-laws.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  isn't anything really that kid  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  recommended a friend  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  cutlet that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  cut up like  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  fingers.  The kids loved it.  Our  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is always  <START:S_Delivery> presented <END>  very well.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  cut  <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END>  to look like birds.  I've never seen anything like it.  My kids were  <START:O_Experience> amazed <END> .  We had to take the  <START:F_FoodItem> carrot birds <END>  home and put them in the refrigerator.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  really  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> .  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , but finished it between the four adults.  It was so  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> .  My father in law said the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushimi <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  was really  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> .  I had  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  sake, and my husband prefers the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cold <END> .  Both were really  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> .  It isn't the most kid  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> , but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do have high  <START:A_Furniture> chairs <END>  available, and the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> patient <END> .  Our  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> , because all of the  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> waitresses <END>  just seem to work together.  No one is only responsible for their  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> , we had  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  filled by  <START:S_Staff> whoever <END>  walked by.   <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  seemed to be  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  on checking every  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  walked by to make sure customers were pleased.  It has really  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  (in the  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END> ) especially for a  <START:F_FI_Size> strip <END>  mall  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  I was really pleasantly surprised.  If nothing else, it's  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for presentation.  I'm really disappointed I didn't have my camera to photograph the way  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  plated our  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  Buffett was surprisingly very  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ! Bottomless  <START:F_Drinks> mimosas <END>  for Memorial  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  started  <START:F_Ingredients> things <END>  off on a high note. It is very upscale and has quite a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  for being a Buffett. I had  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs, which were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> steamed <END> ,  <START:Offers> seasoned <END>  well and already open for  <START:S_Staff> you <END> . I also had  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> smoked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and some  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> items <END> , Chinese  <START:Food> food <END> , all  <START:S_Menu> kinds <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:W_Price> more <END> . The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is very nice & upscale, I would go back!
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is for the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  me, Dine me.It was not very impressive. Our " <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  steward" for the  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END>  admitted  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  didn't even  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  himself but thought we ladies would like the sweeter  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END> . WHAT?!?! Not only were  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  stupid,  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  were insulting too. Maybe the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  should have a  <START:S_Stf_Experience> professional <END>   <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  instead of college kid.The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  was very nice and the first three  <START:F_FoodItem> course <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  but again, not impressed. The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  was the most disappointing, we should have asked for something different. Even the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  implied at the beginning of the  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END>  that the pastry's  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  creation was a  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  shoot....total fail! I should have said something at the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  but only went back later to tell the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  who had left for the  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END> . I would stick to the  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  each morning was  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  so I can only imagine their other  <START:S_Menu> menus <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  too.
Yippe-kai-aaaay! Honey and I met friends  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  last Friday after hearing so many  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> things <END>  about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  joint and I am pleased to let  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  know,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all  <START:A_Places> spot <END>  on. We saddled up to a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  near the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ,  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  (me a  <START:F_Drinks> skinny marg <END>  which was  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> , but a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>  weird because of the bubbly? i guess  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  thought adding  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>   <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  made it skinnier?) and once our friends joined us we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the queso fondue  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> .  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> melted <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , caramelized  <START:F_Ingredients> onions <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> mushrooms <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  with warm  <START:F_FoodItem> tortilla <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> ? Can I get a Hell-yeah? It was super yum. Like moaning at each  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> nummy <END> . Also not too heavy like some  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> -based  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  can be. We got  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and cleaned house. Onto  <START:Food> entrees <END> . Honey and I shared the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  and our friends shared the quesadilla  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> .  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a $2  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  add-on (that my friends, is Brilliant!) and whallah,  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's comes the goods, perfectly timed. Our  <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  were loaded with crispy  <START:F_Ingredients> veggies <END>  -  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  name it, it was in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . Sooooo flipping over the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> . And a testament to their  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was that  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  didn't need to scissor your front teeth for 2  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  after each  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to separate the rest of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  in the  <START:F_FoodItem> tortilla <END>  to that in your mouth. Excellent stuff! Our friends also loved their  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  were the perfect complement to both of our  <START:Food> meals <END> . The  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  - first some  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  with a guitar and a  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  voice and then a  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> - <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  country  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  band were very enjoyable. The  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  wasn't too loud, the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  was excellent and while none of us are country  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  fans, it was fun to hear  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END> 's favorites sung live - and very well. Overall, a  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat and relax and enjoy  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> . We'll certainly be back.
My personal opinon: <START:W_Price> overpriced <END>  WAAAY  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END>  and not  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  wasn't  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  weren't  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was average, the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was  <START:F_Drinks> great <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a beautiful waterfall  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  that is really amazing. But seriously next door at the Venetian is a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  called Trattoria Reggiano it is  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  amazing.
 <START:S_Staff> they <END> 'll  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  - that's cool. The  <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>  are essentially drunk  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Healthy> lots of protein <END>  and not that exotic, but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  fill  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  up. <START:W_Price> more <END>  than one of their delivery  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  have given me desperate phone calls, asking where my house is cause it's dark (after over an hour of  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END> ).  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  no attention to "hold the  <START:F_Ingredients> onions <END> " either - again, based on repeated  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END> . Ahh Willy street hippies....
OMG can  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  say  <START:Food> food <END>  overload? Yes thats what  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  get  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .We all came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  after playing the daily slot  <START:A_Entertainment> tournament <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for the results of the winners (one of us did win the $500!) we found  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in the Imperial Palace and decided to take a break and get some  <START:Food> food <END> .  Well thats an understatement! The  <START:F_FI_Size> portions <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Size> huge <END>  and  <START:Food> everything <END>  was s  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END> .  Its a comfort  <START:Food> food <END>  joint for sure.  Our  <START:Food> lunch <END>  consisted of 3 different  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  and one Quesadilla.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  are "stuffed"  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  choose the  <START:Food> items <END>   <START:S_Staff> you <END>  want inside and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  pout between the two  <START:F_FoodItem> patties <END> .  One of us had the  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  and mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  stuffed  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , one was  <START:F_Ingredients> mushrooms <END>  and swiss, and the other  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheddar <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END> .  Only one of us was able to finish the whole  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  the other two of us  <START:Offers> saved <END>  1/2 for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  The Quesadilla was  <START:F_FI_Size> huge <END>  and over flowing and resting on a bed of mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  which I was told were amazing.  The side of Macaroni and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was said to be the  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END>  Mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  every  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  by 3 in the party so  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> creamy <END>  and cheesy it was the ultimate comfort  <START:Food> food <END>  to drown our  <START:A_Entertainment> gambling <END>  losses! LOL  I recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  gem which is on the second  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  inside Imperial Palace and a reasonable  <START:W_Price> priced <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  considering the  <START:F_FI_Size> quantity <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Staff> you <END>  receive. Especially compared to the rest of the places on the  <START:F_FI_Size> strip <END>  that leave  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  broke AND disappointed. Only  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  that would make  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  perfect is to get some cell  <START:Service> service <END>  inside....No AT&T  <START:Service> service <END>  at all in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , so if  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  have others who are  <START:A_Entertainment> gambling <END>  or trying to find  <START:S_Staff> you <END> , your off the grid in  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .....which could be a  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  thing,  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can concentrate on the  <START:Food> food <END> -gazm your gonna have!
Ate  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on 12/12. The wife got the CARAMEL ALL OVER MY MOCHA very  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END> ! I got the SMORES  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . Very  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> . It had  <START:F_Dessert> marshmallow <END>  fluff that was torched and  <START:Service> served <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> graham crackers <END>  and lots of  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . We shared the MAN VS  <START:Food> food <END>  favorite SAGE  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  BENEDICT! Very  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> plenty <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  for 2.  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  as well.
If  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  haven't done so already,  <START:S_Staff> you <END> 'll have to try the Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ! May sound gross, but  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> -rare and it was so  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> moist <END> ! My husband and I have become regulars  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  past year and have been  <START:Service> treated <END>   <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  by Nate! Go Nate! :) Coleslaw is pretty amazing too!
My dad held his wedding reception  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at one of their private  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> rooms <END> , and it was a  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . We had a three  <START:F_FoodItem> course <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  (then  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  later on) including  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  of  lots and lots of awesome  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  quesadillas, followed by some  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , and then followed by the  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> course <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  mmmmmTheir  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  too, but a bit on the pricey side (around $7 for a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>   <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END> !) I figured when  <START:S_Staff> you <END> 're in vegas,  <START:Food> everything <END>  is  <START:W_Price> expensive <END>  anyway. But our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was really cool and the catering  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> , Kori, was tremendously  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> helpful <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  both came to our  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  often to make sure we were ok.I definitely plan on coming back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  with friends and trying that  <START:F_Drinks> tequila <END>  tasting!
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is my new  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  AYCE  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .I ate  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  4  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  just in 2 month.only $17.95 for luch, $20.95 for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .their  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are so  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> .- If  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  like  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> soft <END>  shell  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  or sweat  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  try their starbucks  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> . - If  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  like  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END> , try die hard!  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  will give  <START:S_Staff> you <END>   <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  of the suace 1 to 5 - If  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  are fan of rainbow  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> , try candycane  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>   <START:S_Staff> you <END>  will like it.- If  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  cannot eat  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  like Korean bulbogi,  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  kama,  <START:F_FoodItem> teriyaki <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  cap, ramen,  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END> , and baked mussels (what I liked about their mussel is that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't put too much  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  like other restaurents so  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  actual mussel not the yum and eel  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .)If  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  like to add nigiri, it is extra $4 for nigiri all U can eat.I had uni, amaebi, Ikura with  <START:F_FoodItem> quail <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> , yellotail,  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and  <START:Food> everything <END>  was so  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  too.the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  refilled my  <START:F_Drinks> beverage <END>  frequently, checked if  <START:Food> everything <END>  was ok in our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .
In a  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  really mean a lot to me. In fact a  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  with a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  I love gets four  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  just for the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  had my all  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  favorite  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  so far in all my  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  adventures. I just loved it.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  round white  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . We even got to sit around it with the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  themselves who  <START:Service> treated <END>  us beautifully.Do  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  think that your  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  in a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is partly BECAUSE of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ? I mean I really enjoyed the people I was visiting with and our conversation was rich but I still wonder that the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  itself contributed to it being an excellent  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . I think so.
I have never had a bad  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> , and my boyfriend and I have eaten  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> . <START:Service> service <END>  is prompt and smiling,  <START:Food> food <END>  is moderately  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  and very tasty, and the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  skates on the edge of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  with élan. A surprisingly nice  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  for the unprepossessing entranceway. I recommend eating inside even if  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 've opened up the front, as the stretch of street the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  fronts on is not the most  <START:A_OutsideView> picturesque <END>  -- and the inside is.
 <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> .  Ok  <START:Service> service <END> .
Two months ago I would have given Merchant two  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  read like a United Colors of Benetton billboard crammed with Thai, Mexican, Indian and  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  ole fashioned American.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a note about  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>  shopping the farmer's  <START:A_Places> market <END>  for what was in season which apparently meant  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  from across the globe than MJ's Heal the World video. A cornucopia of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  that was really hard to read and make sense of. Bartenders were green and pulled out  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>  black books to remember  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  themselves created. It was a mess.BUT, I'm happy to report the  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are a changing! Merchant was AB FAB  <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END> , so much so that I was crafting a review in my head while I was eating (rare that I mix work with pleasure). Get the mussels. TOMORROW.  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're in a creamier  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END>  than I typically prefer but tasty nonetheless.  <START:Service> served <END>  with a  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  rubbed  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  it's a perfect way to start your  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END> , especially if  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  plan to share some stuff with friends and need a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>  nosh early on. I also recommend  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  get the patatas bravas, a  <START:W_Price> more <END>  American take on a classic Spanish  <START:Restaurant> tapas <END> , but  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END>  for a  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END> . Hangar  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END>  was a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> overcooked <END>  for my  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END> , but it had  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  char and a nice  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> , albeit a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>  less pink than I prefer. We  <START:F_FoodItem> subbed <END>  the taters out for  <START:F_FoodItem> frites <END>  and couldn't believe how long  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  stayed warm in the middle. I hate... HAAAATE  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cold <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> frites <END> , even luke warm  <START:F_FoodItem> frites <END> , so whatever these  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  are doing to 'em rawks,  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're magic  <START:F_FoodItem> frites <END> . Super awesome. Any  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that freshly squeezes their  <START:F_Drinks> juice <END>  ranks high in my book, and these  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  are doing it with grapefruits, even though it's 2 bucks a pop at the store right now. (Makes me think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  won't cut corners when  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  rise).  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area was slammed so  <START:Service> service <END>  was a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>  slower, but I didn't have anywhere to go so it didn't matter. Know that when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are usually killer tap  <START:Offers> specials <END> , so the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  will fill up. Grab  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  early like we did and don't be afraid to get all up in someone's face. I did at one point and at the end of the  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  helping us out said thanks for being  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> patient <END>  and flagging him down when we wanted. All in all,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is miles  <START:F_FoodItem> better <END>  than when I was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  over the summer. If  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  haven't been recently give them another try, and as soon as I get back  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and try  <START:W_Price> more <END>  of their concise and easier to read  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , I'll let  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  know how it goes!
Hands down the  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END>   <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  in Las Vegas. It wouldn't be a stretch to consider  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  one of the  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END>  overall  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Las Vegas either.  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  see,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  isn't your  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  Vegas value  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  (think Griswold's Vegas Vacation). No, these  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  with superior  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  look attractive too. I loved the southern  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  in a mini  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fry <END>  basket. The various Chinese  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  mini Chinese take-out  <START:F_FI_Quality> boxes <END>  were cool too. The Korean short  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  are both must tries.  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  can't get bone marrow at your local Golden Corral ether. Again, get the  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  " <START:Restaurant> buffet <END> "  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>  out of your head!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  stuff  <START:Service> served <END>  to satisfy your  <START:F_Appetizer> appetite <END>  and then some. Be sure to hit up the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  afterwards. The  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  covered  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  and french macarons were very rich and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END> !Highlights: <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  short ribsCrab legs  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and gritsSouthern  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  chickenPrime ribDessert  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> !
Tooooo disappointed..... I was want to give three Starnes it was not that bad but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are many five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  and I really want ppl know what's going on now...When  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  grand opening, was $23/person. It was so  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> !!! Nice  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END> , also outstanding  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>  ..... Around two years after, I went it again, as it was my #1  <START:S_Menu> choice <END> . $35 (around) per person. No  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  available but  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> smoked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> .... It still ok, as it has  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:F_Dessert> desert <END> ..... Ok.... I went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  last Saturday for $44 with tax per person with my friend, who never been to Vegas .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  asked me why u love  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  ad it's below average..... I would rather find a hold....  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  only a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> smoked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ... Poor  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>  was not like before...  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no point I should go back  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ! Very disappointed me! It's not only I  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  over 40 for a  <START:Food> dinner <END> , it was like destroy my dream.... I will never go to any  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  at Vegas... The $20  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  at Rowland heights is  <START:F_FoodItem> better <END>  than  <START:Restaurant> this <END> ! I have question for the  <START:S_Staff> management <END> , why  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  do  <START:Restaurant> this <END> ? Because  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  have pretty  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  at yelp?  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  are destroying yourself!
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is usually pretty  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> . Nice  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection.  <START:Food> food <END>  is pretty  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  . Not too fancy but definitely  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> 
very very tasty  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ,  <START:W_Price> expensive <END>  yes but i enjoyed every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  :]  .. still not as  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  as original grimaldis in Brooklyn but  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  enough.
The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  is made to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , so it takes a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>  longer than most "fast  <START:Food> food <END> "  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:A_Places> joints <END> .  Not to worry..  It's well  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .I've eaten  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a handful of  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are pretty consistent with their  <START:Service> service <END>  and their  <START:Food> food <END> .   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  weekend, I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  via the drive-thru  <START:A_Furniture> window <END> , and when I got home, my fries were still crunchy.  That's always a plus for me.
Finally, I found  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  done right!  I have eaten a  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  dozen  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  on the last six months that have been  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END> -par at  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END> !  Unfortunately, 8.5 miles away but in the  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>  of my new doc so, I will be back!!!!
 <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  left something to be desired, as well as the  <START:S_Del_Time> late <END>  90's pop  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> , but nothing that would keep us from coming back. We will definitely be back next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we are in town.The ' <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END> ' definitely took a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  out of my mother-in-law who likes  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also have a 'thai  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END> ' that should really get  <START:S_Staff> you <END> . We found the  <START:Food> food <END>  rich and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END>  unlike some places where the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  are  <START:F_Drinks> watered <END>  down. We enjoyed the spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , tom kha  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ),  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ),  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  saute ( <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ), and thai  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> iced <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> . All were excellent.
I'm not going to be redundant with  <START:A_Decor> pictures <END>  or descriptions of our  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END> .  Let me just say that it is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  a drive from the  <START:F_FI_Size> strip <END>  and I consider it a bargain for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and yumminess.  The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  was VERY  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and made it a point to visit with every  <START:F_Drinks> patron <END> .  It was a really outstanding visit and I will be going back when in Vegas again!
Thanks to a Google  <START:Offers> offer <END>  that was expiring on Thursday, I made it a point to stop at the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  Hive.  After a long  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  of work I was looking for some  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  refreshment and relaxation.We arrived about 5:40p, just ahead of  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  else fortunately.  Got one of the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:A_Places> floor <END>  and our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  promptly stopped over with  <START:S_Menu> menus <END>  and requests for  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a nice chalkboard full of the craft brews on tap but I wanted to see how the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  would handle suggestions.  Without just touting a selected brew our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  skillfully asked about preferences and current likes/dislikes.   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  then made a couple of suggestions which really hit the mark.  I had an Atwater Conniption Fit, double IPA which was very  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> .  My son had a Draai Laag Aureus which  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  enjoyed.  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  Pretzel apps that came with a nice house made honey  <START:F_Ingredients> mustard <END>  dip.  For  <START:Food> dinner <END>  my son had the BELT,  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> tomato <END>  which was quite tasty and I had the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Taquitos.   <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was excellent for an after work hang out and grabbing a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat.   <START:F_FI_Size> plenty <END>  of screens to watch multiple events and a  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> , up to  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>  juke.I look forward to hitting  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:A_Places> spot <END>  again.
be prepared for over  <START:Offers> seasoned <END>  and over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> ..... Watery  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bisque <END>  and flavorless  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . 40$ of nothing. Totally disappointed. Who puts  <START:F_FoodItem> oregano <END>  in a  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> ?
While the  <START:Food> food <END>  was super tasty, we received it in  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END> :  <START:Food> entrees <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  didn't even seem to understand that  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was a problem nor did  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  explain why it was happening (well,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had to go buy  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  for the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , that was the holdup  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ). While  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was only one other  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  completely forgot about us after dropping the check and let us sit with it for over 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> . I wish their  <START:Service> service <END>  matched their tasty  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> !
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is always  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  and the hibachi is such a  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  deal.  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>  are always  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and entertaining
Hyde is a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  where money hungry women go to and  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  who  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> act <END>  like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have money go to.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  going out  <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END>  to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and like the other  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  group  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was no different. Me and my friends came cause we had a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  with other friends  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  took forever letting us in even though we were already part of a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . It's a shame when  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  see host letting other people in before  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  cause  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  know them.  What is the nightlife on Vegas coming to. Vegas  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  clubs really don't know the meaning of customer  <START:Service> service <END> . So so so sad. I heard about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  lace and wanted to see what was so  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  about it. But to tell  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  nothing is  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> . It's to  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END> ,  and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> horrible <END> . A lot of beautiful women with no brains. Lol. The host at the front, well some of them are ignorant and really don't know  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  job. Once we finally got in I was disappointed how the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was set up. The dance  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  was like the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of my living  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and no  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to dance. The structure of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> horrible <END>  when going to the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END>  also. Too  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . It's funny to cause after I said I was giving  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  a bad review while in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  that's when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  got us in. Sorry to  <START:S_Del_Time> late <END> . My review is still bad. Nightclubs need to realize  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  are to make sure people have a  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and not worrying about when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are going to get in.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was my first and last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  coming back to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
So i recieved a text that my  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  roomate was working  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  told me I had to stop in.  We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  rather quickly and the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  even turned the knicks  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  on for us.  As my friend and I must try to the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  everywhere, we didn't stop  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . We did 6 Po Po  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and 6 jamiacan jerk.  Can I say the Po Po  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are the  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  I have ever eaten in Charlotte?  Well screw  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  I just did boom!  The jamiacan weren't that bad either as  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  didnt have that over chivey  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  Unfortunately we both  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  ( i would have liked to see another  <START:Food> entree <END> ), but it worked out in a way.  The sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  fries were amazing and the  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  very well.  We marveled at how well the  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  was.  The only problem I had was the suace was a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>  too tangy, but my friend thought it was  <START:F_Drinks> great <END> .  To each their own I guess.  The  <START:W_Price> price <END>  wasn't too bad and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  will def be a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  i repeat.  The only problem I had was  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  as  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  on any roads that  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> .
Very speedy  <START:Service> service <END>  and a well-made  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . I'm frequently in the Burgh for work and my office is super  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Most  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END> , I try and do a "working  <START:Food> lunch <END> ".I can get a tasty, healthy and filling  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for cheap - in and out of the store in (at the absolute most) 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .For what I'm looking for,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is as  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  as it gets.
Where to start...my bf and I went on Father's  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> . We were told up front  <START:F_Ingredients> things <END>  would be awhile but did  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  not get the memo  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were working a busy Sunday holiday? Unfortunately our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was embarrassingly  <START:A_OutsideView> terrible <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was nice but  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  clearly did not  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was messing up our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and just about any  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  near us. We were  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> patient <END>  but  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  literally messed up  <START:Food> everything <END>  from start to finish.  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  forgot to give a  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  to my bf, didn't charge me for the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  I did  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  (which fine w me!) but the  <START:Food> food <END>  took wayyy too long and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  brought me the wrong thing.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also forgot the one  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  then when I asked  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  brought me too (again a mistake  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  made in my favor...sweet) I ended up sending back the incorrect  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and at that point I was so hungry and over the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I just asked for a  <START:F_FoodItem> muffin <END> . It was dry and disappointing. The check took forever to get too. Would not recommend and never going back. Dottie's is a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  mess.
The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is bomb just don't go around  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  during weekdays, not only is it  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END>  but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  rush and end up ruining your  <START:Food> food <END> . Also today the lady tried to charge me 15$ for 3  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  and a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  which is usually 8.50$ or something. Really  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END>  at anytime but not from 11-3 on weekdays.
Second visit!  We couldn't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to get back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  since discovering it on our trip to Scorrsdale last year!  We actually almost  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the same thing again, since it was so  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  last year.  We started with the in-house made pretzel and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  dip, and I had a Chimay Cinq Cents and my wife  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Wethenstephan hefe since  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  likes lighter  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> .  Both were miraculous to me!  We then followed up with  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  the refinedReviews flight, three mini sliders on  <START:F_FoodItem> buns <END>  including the Haus refinedReviews,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with sauerkraut, the  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  refinedReviews  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with root  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  sauteed  <START:F_Ingredients> onions <END> , and the sweet refinedReviews  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  red  <START:F_Ingredients> peppers <END> .  Add one of the many  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> mustards <END>  in the six pack we had on our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , and  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  have perfection!  The flight included 4 oz.  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  to accompany each slider, and all were perfect pairings.  The  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  Judy had the dining  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  and  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  all to herself and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> , warm and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and it was amazing to watch her multi-task.  One again a visit to the Brat Haus was a highlight of our vacation and since we are staying in the area for two weeks once again, we will probably be back next week!  So different and fun with all of the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and refinedReviews  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> !  We went early so  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  on the street was easy.  (Last year we had a hike going later at  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and had to  <START:A_Places> park <END>  around the corner illegally 8-})
I really like  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> buffet <END> ! I'm not a  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  person but I think  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the one to go to when in Vegas. It is  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END>  to go on a weekday and early. I wanted to try their  <START:Food> breakfast <END> / <START:Food> lunch <END> . We went on a Thursday around 9:30 and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  about 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .I LOVED the Asian  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . It is situated in the far back. Don't miss it. My favorites are Shanghai dumplings, dim sum (Hai Gow, Shumai), thousand year  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  congee ( <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END> ), ramen,  <START:F_FoodItem> pho <END> , wonton  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , udon,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , lo mein, eggrolls, potstickers, and many  <START:W_Price> more <END> ... I know it is legit because the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>  were all speaking Cantonese. However, the Shanghai dumplings could be  <START:F_FoodItem> better <END>  if the skin was a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>  thinner. It is fine for a Vegas  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END> .Some other  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  to try is the croque madame and the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and waffles.  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END> ! I am glad most of the  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  are  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  control. That helps me not eat so much but I end up getting up often to grab  <START:W_Price> more <END> . So I don't know how that helps... I still ate a lot. We stayed until  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  transitioned to  <START:Food> lunch <END> . We had a few  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Not impressed. I think I am sticking with the Asian  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  with the all- <START:S_Staff> you <END> -can-eat dim sum.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> buffet <END>  really impressed me!!!
I got the carne asada  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were pretty tasty plus  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  selection of  <START:F_Drinks> tequilas <END> .
We stopped by for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  on a  <START:S_Del_Time> late <END>  Saturday afternoon. It was still a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>  busy from it being opening week, so  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a bit of a  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was  <START:S_Del_Time> quick <END>  though, so the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  wasn't too long.The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is like every other  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Rio out  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . Vibrant and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . A comfortable fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to have a  <START:Food> meal <END> .The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is fast and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  takes a  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>  getting used too, but the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> helpful <END> .We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  barbacoa  <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  and a sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  barbacoa  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . Both with  <START:F_FI_Taste> mild <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . It was hard to stop eating my  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  even after I knew I had eaten too much. The  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  and could feed two people (maybe).We will definitely be back (repeatedly) to try out all of the other  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END> .
 <START:F_Drinks> great <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are low!
Delicioso!! New  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  of south america in one  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  work as  <START:Restaurant> buffet <END> . My favorite is the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  a la brasa!! Uhhhh muy rico.
Had to send the  <START:Food> food <END>  back because it was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cold <END> , however the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  was extremely  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> helpful <END> .  The Forrest Gump trivia was funny, so brush up on your Forrest Gump trivia.  I didn't realize I know so much about the movie.
I was a lil disappointed upon arriving to see that  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was so  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  (I was asked to meet someone for  <START:Food> lunch <END> ) because I was told it "was the  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in Az." However after  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  and devouring my  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  of our made to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  I must say its one of the  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END>  I've had and will definitely be back!
We were looking for a reasonably  <START:W_Price> priced <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Scottsdale and found  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  on Yelp. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  as and hubby  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  calamari and  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> . The two  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  are way too much  <START:Food> food <END>  for one person,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  them on two  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  for sharing. So we split both  <START:Food> meals <END> .  <START:Food> everything <END>  was excellent. We even got to meet the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  who was going from  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  to  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeting <END>   <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  and making sure the  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> . We are in Scottsdale for a few  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>  and at hoping to get back  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  before we leave.
what a beautiful  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  and for the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  it was  <START:W_Price> more <END>  than expected  <START:Food> food <END>  was awesome the prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  is to die for. the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  is  <START:F_Drinks> great <END>  the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  playing area is always busy and full so plan on having Patience  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  are 1.00 enjoy  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is the hit  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to the  <START:F_FI_Size> strip <END>  and a lot of places to eat at .....loved it cant  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to return soon....Phil C
Came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to try out before my next appointment. As some reviews had mentioned, it was like a  <START:Food> hawaiian <END>  Chipotle. Step 1 - choose one -   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , bowl,  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , or  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  - Step 2 - choose one -  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , pig,  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> veggies <END> )Step 3 - choose any - seaweed  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  OR brown  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , black  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> , and grilled veggiesStep 4 - choose one- charged  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END>  verde,  <START:F_Dessert> mango <END>  &  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> tomato <END>  w/ grilled maui onionsStep 5 - choose any - sour cream,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeno <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END> , lime,  <START:F_FoodItem> cilantro <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts, habenero, lava chipsMy combination was a  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  with the huli huli  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , seaweed  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , black  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> mango <END>  &  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END> , sour cream,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeno <END> . It was $6.95 + tax .. pretty similar to chipotle in  <START:W_Price> pricing <END>  but a different  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . To be honest, i thought  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  wasnt really  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . It was quite plain. The only thing that really STOOD out was the jalepeno. Surprisingly  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  despite a lot of other places with jalepenos werent really  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  lately. Aside from that, not much  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  in the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , not the  <START:F_Dessert> mango <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> . Was expecting maybe bright  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  from the  <START:F_Dessert> mango <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  but not really o.O Heard it may be because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are opening another  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  in the north side and the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  wasn't  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for QC? thats kind of bad if  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is only kept up when managed.... May give it another try but with first  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> ... eh Lol
A  <START:A_Env_Size> little <END>  confusing for the first trip, but nice after  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  figure out the  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  system. Been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  twice so far.  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Quality> good <END> .  Definitely try the brownie if  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  like sweets.
Being a  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  fan of pad thai, I just had to try  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  on 35th Avenue near  Northern which was near my  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  stomping grounds. I found their pad thai to be well- <START:Offers> seasoned <END>  though a bit less dry ("dry" being a preferred style for some pad thai aficionados), and without the cloying sweetness found in  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  when  <START:Service> served <END>  in some Thai  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> . Plus, the  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  is  <START:W_Price> more <END>  generous than in several of the Thai eateries I've tried.The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is modest and the  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  in the  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  are well-worn but serviceable.  <START:Service> service <END>  is  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  relatively inexpensive.
We just had  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is AMAZING!The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was deliciousMeatballs were really flavorfulPizza was excellentBaked  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  ( Lasagna) was to die for! <START:Food> chocolate <END>  Tiramisu was heavenlyOrange Mio Espresso was the  <START:F_Ingredients> best <END>  way to  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>  off the mealMake  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and go!Don't forget to hit the photobooth before  <START:S_Staff> you <END>  leave. It is quite hidden by the front desk.
