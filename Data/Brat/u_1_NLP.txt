I like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  here...I've only visited in the past for  <START:Offers> happy   hour   <END>  or  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  out with friends. Recently, both times I came late in the evening after work functions and arrived hungry. Coincidentally, both nights I was there was also  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  night.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's an interesting  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END> , all ages, just gettin' their  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  on. I enjoy the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> , but will sit back and let the "pros" do the dancing.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have friendly  <START:Service> service <END> , a few outdoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and a huge  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a pretty lounge-y vibe. There is a decent  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> / <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  list, and also specialty  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END> . Both times, I tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , which was not bad at all - not comparing to a Japanese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but for a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was done well. The  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>  one was really hot,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with a jalepeno: nice touch. I also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the house  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , which was a  <START:Food> meal <END>  in itself. Seriously  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was huge! The  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  were fresh, and with some  <START:F_Drinks> balsamic <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>  oil,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very enjoyable. For  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  or  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  fare, Bossa Nova is one happening spot in the downtown area, which seems to be on the up and up!

MacAlpine's is a staple of old Phoenix. Dating back to the30's, this  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END>   <START:Service> serviced <END>  customers of the valley since 7st was a dirt road off the beaten path.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do a  <START:Service> great job <END>  retaining the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  of an age gone by,  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiched <END>  on both sides by antique and vintage stores. There's plenty to look at. Unfortunately I can't say the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  or cow) were very good. Not bad, just bland and uninspired. The  <START:F_Drinks> sodas <END>  are fun. On my first visit I tried 2 of the 99 options, including Marilyn Monroe (peach) and Tiger Blood (cherry  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END> ). Both were good, but next time I'm going to ask for way less syrup. All in all I'd say I would come back again and again, but probably just for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .

We came here last Sunday on Father's day for the  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END> .  <START:W_Price> price <END>  is definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  for the  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> . $25 for the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  style for the cold items and $10 extra for the unlimited made to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  small plates of 7 different hot items,  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  not included. The  <START:Food> buffet <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END> , 4 diff  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , assorted  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked   salmon   <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked duck <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> caviar <END> , varieties of  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> . I am not usually big fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  at  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but theirs were really good and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfect. A bit disappointed that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put all the  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimps <END>  on top but the bottom ones hidden under the  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  ones were the small ones. The  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked   salmon   <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked duck <END>  were awesome.  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were very pretty and decent but mostly too sweet to my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were pretty good. We tried all the 7 hot plates to be shared among the 3 of us, the lamb was soooo delish that I had two  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and I don't usually even like the smell of lamb, but this didnt have the heavy smell. The  <START:F_FoodItem> waffle <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  were really good, except that I didn't quite enjoy the combination of the  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  bits on the  <START:F_FoodItem> waffle <END> . I also loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  mini  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . Polenta was yuck and the most raved  <START:F_FoodItem>   egg   benedict <END>  was not special. I didn't get to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and mac n  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , but hubby said the  <START:F_FoodItem> macncheese <END>  was good but  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was just average. We called ahead to let them know that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was also our anniversary and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would take note of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  didn't appear that any note was made. I know  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's only  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  and not full dinner but would still appreciate a bit recognition on  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , so I ended up asking the host if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  could do something. So came an  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END>  plate with chocolate writing saying Happy Anniversary on  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and was told to get some  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  from the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  to put on the plate. May be that's how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , I don't have complaint but was not exactly expecting an  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END>  plate :) Overall, I would have no problem returning there for a casual upscale  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END> .

What a find!!!  I drive by this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  all the time and always mentally say "humm Jess, you should try that  <START:Restaurant> place <END> " next time i am going to listen to my gut, because i was missing out!  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END>  is a very cute, cozy  <START:Ambience> set up <END> .  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  is super nice here. You get complimentary won ton  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and delicious Chinese  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  when you get  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> ( this is pretty rare). The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  which lead us into gluttony...and people i am NOT ashamed because  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was derrrlicious :)edamame, ribs, angel puffs(crab puff),  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> lemon   chicken   <END> , honey walmut  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  (catching my breath)..sake..more hot  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> ..and then  <START:F_Appetizer> cookies <END>  and chocolate for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ....yummmmhonestly i eat Chinese/Asian/Thai A LOT, and this was one of the best  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  i have came across in my quest for  great Asian  <START:Food> food <END> . why not  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> five   stars   <END>  then you say?? well i am a fan of  <START:A_Furniture> windows <END> (none here), and i just can't hand out  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> five   stars   <END>  like candy. But def a high four!

Don't come for the  <START:Service> service <END> ...don't come for the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  or cleanliness...don't come for the other  <START:Food> food <END> . Come for the pie. Jack Daniel's Pecan is divine.  Lemon cream is outstanding. Rhubarb is top-notch. there's no other reason to stop here and if you're driving by you need to stop here.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's all about the pie.

I am use to going here for teppan ( <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ) and  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and have always had a good  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Better than Benihana! <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and helpful.This was my first time here for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are great. I also love that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer half  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  on some of their  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Teriyaki w/  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  Tempura, comes with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> miso   soup   <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very tasty. And  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a good  <START:F_FI_Size> amount <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  for $8.50. I also got Unagi  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , which was okay. I got to sample around at some of my friends  <START:Food> food <END> ...Hamachi Kama which I've never had was yummy and the Uni  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  (wasn't as bad as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looks:)We also got different  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  at the end, the Chocolate Tempura  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  Cream was heavy but yummy,  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like a funnel cake with  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream. The Chocolate Soufflé was delicious, the warm chocolate filling made the  <START:Food> dish <END> . My favorite was the Flan (yes at a Japanese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ),  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was reminiscent of creme brulee. The  <START:F_FoodItem> mochi <END>  wasn't great, might have been in the freezer too long.

While the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in this spot doesn't hold a candle to I Love  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Fever, the  <START:Service> service <END>  and half  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  make up for  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  overall. I consistently have a great  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  here and have never had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . Plus, there is very little bullsh$t at the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  which is sometimes appreciated on a "school" night. The Hibachi is another story altogether,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is a tasty affair and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  is some of the best I've ever had! Most certainly  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  a visit!

I've only been here once and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't busy so  <START:Service> service <END>  was not a problem when I went. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was soooo good! We had the pernil which was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> moist <END>  and delicious, tostones, maduras,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , moros y cristianos. Omg  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was awesome! I will definitely go back!

Excellent  <START:Food> food <END> , great  <START:Service> service <END> .  Wished we had found this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  a couple years ago when we moved here.   <START:W_Price> price <END>  is excellent and  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  very comfortable.  Found our new "Chinese  <START:Food> cuisine <END> !"

Dinner for 4.  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  was happy for the most part. My  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  was a little salty. Hubs  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was delish!  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  looked great and our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was nice.

I have been to Azteca many times and have always been satisfied. This time not so much. I can't put my finger on the reason, but I have to wonder if this time was an exception, or if the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had changed. Before this visit I would have  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rated <END>  Azteca 4, but now  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a generous 3.

I have just discovered the Common Market and I couldn't be happier that I did.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  reminds me of a funky little deli from back home so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  gives me the warm fuzzies while I peruse their killer  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  a micro brew lover could want, including big bottles and single serve, build your own 6 packs.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also have a great  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  selection and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  even carry sake!  There are lots of  <START:F_Appetizer> snacks <END> ,  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  items, and organic choices, as well as off the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:Service> treats <END>  and trinkets like "Obama-mints."  I have never actually eaten at the deli, but I'm sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's great too.  Oh and you can also buy single cigarettes for 33 cents.....so, if you are craving just one, CM is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go.

After  reading the Yelp reviews, I went to Diamond around 3pm in the afternoon for a "snack".  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a surprisingly sophisticated  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a bloody mary made with their house mix, absolut  <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with pickled  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> .  As I am watching the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  make the bloody mary, she puts the cheapest  <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END>  in the glass and then precedes to pour a mix over  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  which had a terrible  <START:A_Decor> color <END> !  I love a good bloody mary.  This bloody mary was no bueno -  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END> , crappy mix and no pickled  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> .  On to the  <START:Food> food <END>  - I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer>   fried   pickles <END> .  The  <START:F_Appetizer>   fried   pickles <END>  were good - the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  were not.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were chewy, not  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>  and dry.  Fast forward 3  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  and I feel terrible - in fact, I am in and out of the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END>  for a good 2 hours.  NEVER AGAIN.  If you're looking for good,  <START:W_Price> cheap <END> , greasy  <START:Food> food <END>  try Pinky's!

The  <START:F_FoodItem> queso <END>  is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade  <START:F_FoodItem> tortillas <END>  are also outstanding.Aside from that,  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican  <START:Food> cuisine <END> . This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the  <START:Food> food <END> . Hence making  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.We started with the  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  set for the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  - delicious. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a bunch of  <START:F_FoodItem> queso <END>  for the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , and I started with a Tortilla  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  scraps, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looked the part.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  broth with a bunch of  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> , a gob of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was lousy and I wouldn't recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a pound of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  and a half pound of  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee).  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  went surprisingly far for five of us... but the  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  weren't grilled much, which is sad because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were otherwise delicious. Also, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  only had one piece of green  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  and one of red on top.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  should be lush with  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  that have been grilled or possibly even  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> caramelized <END>  (the  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> ).Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be "more than a pile of  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> ," that he expected at least some green, red or yellow  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent -  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> , sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.So much potential, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  fails on almost  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a true shame. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  needs to be on  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...This time around... the  <START:Service> service <END>  was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . Very disappointing. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  first replied confirming what size bug  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was, and then explained  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and claimed that "we're not dirty,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just the  <START:Food> food <END>  smell." Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!And the  <START:A_Places> entry foyer <END>  smelled like a high school locker  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> ...  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was foul on the way in and out.Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had the cheapest and best falafil (that is how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  spell  <START:Restaurant> it <END> )  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  of anywhere in town.The falafel was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> moist <END> , flavorful the  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  was fresh and there was a copious  <START:F_FI_Size> amount <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  to cover  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  was a bit  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  but that can be over looked. At under $3  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  might be worthwhile to get two. As for the hummous we had on the side,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a great texture but a bit low on  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . Make sure you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  an extra  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  comes with just one. We got the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to go so we did not really have any  <START:Service> service <END>  to review.  When you first walk in you are assaulted by the smells of many spices and many other alien things to most Americans. There is an attached small market full of spices, and exotics  <START:Food> foods <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END>  tobaccos for those under 21 who seek a vice. The counter is full of many types of balaclava and  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END> .If you want a great falafel  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  at a good  <START:W_Price> price <END> , be brave and stop in. Just leave your Pro Bush / Israel gear in the car.

Ok, I get  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  that  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  is excited you finally opened.We (party of 5) came in today for  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END> .After asking two  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  3 time for  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and half way thru my  <START:Food> meal <END> , I finally got  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> .  I also asked our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  for the habanero  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  which I had to remind him again half way thru my  <START:Food> meal <END> .  After  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  our check 2 of decided to have a shot of corralejo tequila. I went to the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  where I stood for over 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  while the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  watched the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  ignoring me. I left and the returned, still no  <START:Service> service <END> .  I finally said in a loud voice to the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> . Quit watching the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and get me our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . This is a terrible way to keep customers.  Not sure we will return.  $30 for 2 shots that I pretty much had to beg to get is rediculous.  Happy Holidays.

 <START:Food> food <END>  is amazing  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have the best BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  I've ever had in Las Vegas!!!! I also tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> pot stickers <END>  and orange  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> !! All  I highly recommend this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  to all who enjoy great  <START:Service> service <END>  and a relaxing dining  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> !

You can't really go wrong when you walk into a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a beautiful bottle of peppery Zinfandel and a decadent  <START:Food> meal <END>  with all your favorite things.  I was dazzled with my dinner choice comprised of a petite file mignon  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with crab, drizzled with a crab mignonette cream, goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  whipped  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END>  fritti, sauteed wild  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , and brussel sprouts sauteed in pancetta, lemon, and browned  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> .  Not to mention that I had the best key lime pie yet! Simply flavorful, simply  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> , and simply a great choice to satisfy my craving for  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  Hats off to the Palm!

i always come here once a year for the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  bordelaise n pomme  <START:F_FoodItem> frites <END> !! Their  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  is the only one i would eat..  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are so  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  n tasty. <START:F_FoodItem> escargot <END>  is good.. for adventurous foodie... n not for the faint hearted... or country bumpkin who's not open minded to try anything at least once.the pate is good.. the  <START:F_Drinks> roasted butternut squash   soup   <END>  is good...

If you ever want to eat somewhere with delicious  <START:Food> food <END>  and have stunning  <START:A_OutsideView> views <END>  of the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  show at the Bellagio, this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to be!  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END> 's had incredible  <START:Service> service <END>  and appetizing  <START:Food> food <END> ! My boyfriend and I had our Anniversary dinner here and let me just say,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is one that I'll never forget. A few tips:Make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and if you don't mind eating a early dinner, make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  for 5, that's when dinner starts. You'll for sure get a good  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  or  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END> . <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , a nice dinner is not complete without a tasty  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  bellinis and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were perfect.Don't eat too much  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  because the  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are pretty decent. From  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty hard for me to stop snacking on the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END> . But you want  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for their mouthwatering  <START:Food> entrees <END> ! I had the ricotta  <START:F_FoodItem> raviolis <END>  with italian sausage and my boyfriend had the goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  dumplings with  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , this was mainly where my 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  rating came from. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazingly delectable!!!!!!!

Never in my life did I  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>  myself hitting up a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  in Vegas. What can I say.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  always seemed gimmicky I guess. So I crashed here for a night. The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  was pimp and exceeded expectation. I had been driving all freaking day and in dire need of something delicious. No  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> , no  <START:F_Appetizer> snacks <END>  and screw eating shit from the mini  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . So me and buddy mosey on down to the   <START:Food> buffet <END>  while gawking at the numerous hot females walking around.Back to the  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was great first and foremost. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was just okay, bland and the selection of  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  was pretty eh. Anyway not  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . The Prime Rib was really juicy and satisfied my craving for blood. The  <START:F_FoodItem> king crab legs <END>  were really good and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were mighty tasty. The  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  stuffed  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  things were great, smothered in a creamy white  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Pesto mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> , duck,  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> spareribs <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , dim sum,  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was really good and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END>  was overall pretty good. I left this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  feeling like a really content blob. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great and the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were pretty good. Nice  <START:Food> buffet <END> ... good enough to wipe my  <START:Food> buffet <END>  grudge away for the time being.

BASED ON  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  TO-GO:First of all, can we give a shout out to all joints that serve their  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  all day? *applause* Already started off with 1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> .2nd  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  came when we found out we could  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to-go &  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be ready to pick up in 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> , smack dab in the middle of their morning rush. *High-five Lux!*3rd  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  came when we picked up our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  off to the side of the entrance where the bakery is and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  conveniently had other items like baked goods and all different kinds of  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . I see you, Lux. I see you!4th  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  came when I bit into that scrumptious  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  sammich. That bad boy was huge! I thought I had  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two of them or something. But don't me wrong, I still devoured that sucker,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  just took me a little longer. Only thing is that I wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put a tiny bit more effort into their hash browns. Mine were kinda bland and barely  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> . Another off note: we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  ranch over the phone, when we picked up we also confirmed if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  packed the ranch ( <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did), but when we got back to our  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> , no ranch to be seen. Bummer cause ranch is my boo boo. Not cool, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  happens.Something to note- I'm not sure of its connection to The Cheesecake Factory:  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  used to be one?  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's owned by the same company? Not sure but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  definitely had the same vibe and I love me some CF so I ain't mad at  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !I would definitely come back!

We went here because we got a  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  card for Xmas, I thought  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was delish we stared off with the calamari was a little under seasoned but not fishy, the complementary  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was great and then we had a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  flatbread that was good the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was the nicest ever. We had a fifty dollar  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  card and ended up using $38 on dinner and two  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and gave the rest to her for being super nice. Would go again even without a  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  card.

This review is coming from someone who was born and raised in HK. We have different standard on Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  than people from other culture. If you happened to be from an area outside of Canton/HK this review will not help you. This used to be my most favorite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Vegas for its high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  authentic cantonese  <START:Food> cuisine <END> ...yet the most recent visit proved to a a disaster...this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had lost its authentic cantonese  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , the pan  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  was saturated with gravy, my pan  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  was over filled with sweet and sour  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was supposed to be dry), and the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  rib  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  just gross.  <START:Service> service <END>  is ok; but I would say that  <START:Food> food <END>  had downgraded to American Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  style...I will not come back.

I love this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is beautiful and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is delicious.

Great creativity and fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> . Execution? Good, but not stellar. Most of us had luke warm  <START:Food> food <END> , but I was too lazy (since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  felt like forever to get our  <START:Food> food <END> ), to cry about  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and send  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back. More like a 3-4 range, but the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and temperature were lacking.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do have an awesome smores mocha that you should probably share. Actually, share anything you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  because the portion will be monster. We came for  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  on a Friday and had a short  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> . Best thing was probably my friend's banana  <START:F_FoodItem> french toast <END> . That was tasty and the broiled (?) bananas were the perfect addition. Would I go again for that  <START:W_Price> price <END> ? Probably not. Maybe the San Diego sister  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  would be better....

Fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to hangout at, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have this really cool bridge.........lol

My wife and I go here a couple times a year for quite a while now.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is very good, as is the  <START:Service> service <END> . I usually get the lasagna without looking much at the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  The house chianti works well.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's all certainly good enough that we keep going back.  The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is usually quiet, even when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is busy.  That means we can talk easily in a calm voice.On the nights that Augie is there with his accordion, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is usually busier, and I have to think  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's at least partly because of Augie.  He doesn't just play around with the squeeze box--he's Good!  He's a classically trained musician, and really puts himself into  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , especially when he knows you appreciate  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .

This review should be split into two categories:  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was 5- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .  Flavorful, generous, and delicious.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was 2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .  Our party was one of two in the entire  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  Due to the fact the 3  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  in another part of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  catching up, I had to get up and request  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and other things we needed.  From start to finish,  <START:Food> lunch <END>  for 3 people took close to 1.5 hours between  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for  <START:Service> service <END> .  Always happy to find a good Ethiopian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and definitely recommend the  <START:Food> food <END>  here.  Just plan on the extra time for the  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  you will do.

Our favorite Mediterranean  <START:Food> food <END>  in the valley. Huge  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> swarms combo <END>  are our favorite. Also recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> roasted lamb hummus <END> . Phoenicia is awesome!

Great  <START:Service> service <END> .  We enjoy the  <START:Food> food <END> , but I believe the Naperville, IL  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is better.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  seem to offer a larger variety of specials.  But, and thats a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  but, the Scottsdale  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is still a must try.  My favorite item is the Quinoa  <START:F_FoodItem>   veggie     burger   <END> .

I think I would have to agree with Kristin and Sunny and say that this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  gets a lot more credit that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  might otherwise deserve because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a non-chain, non-fast  <START:Food> food <END>  Chinese  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in South Phoenix. I admire the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  for taking a risk and opening this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in this particular area and for bringing some ethnic  <START:Food> food <END>  to the masses. That being said, the  <START:Food> food <END>  isn't spectacular. The first time my husband and I went there,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was at dinnertime and we thought the  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  Honey  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  ($7.95) was a bit too sweet and not as  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  as one would hope, but the Mongolian  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  ($9.50) was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and pretty flavorful. We also had the Crab Puffs for $4.95, which were fine but no better than the ones at Panda Express. The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were low,  <START:Service> service <END>  good, and overall,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was an ok dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . However, when we returned for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  today, we were a bit disappointed. Having enjoyed a  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  during the last visit, I decided to try the Volcano  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  special. My husband got the General Tso  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . Their website says  <START:Food> lunch <END>  specials are $4.95, but I believe  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were $5.50 each. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was ok, but again,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't that  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> . Sesame  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , General Tso  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , and other similar  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are only really good if the outside is very  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  adds  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  not sogginess. The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that came with the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>  and flavorful and the accompanying  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  (carrot,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> broccoli <END> , and bok choy) were really fresh, but the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  itself was really bad  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . On the upside, the  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  that came with both  <START:Food> lunch <END>  specials was really good. The filling was savory, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  almost  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  in  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> ! I am certainly glad that the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  of Sun Asian  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  brought Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  to South Phoenix, but I hope that many more Asian restaurateurs follow suit and open  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in this area, so that Kristin, Sunny, and I have more options to choose from! Until then, I'll be frequenting Sun Asian  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  for  <START:Offers> happy   hour   <END>  (in particular, for the $3 crab puffs) or to-go and driving elsewhere when I went real, good- <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  Asian  <START:Food> food <END> .

I went here today.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and was told  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're out of  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> .  Are you serious?  That's a first ever for me.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  was like $7.  That's an insane  <START:W_Price> price <END>  for a  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  but I was hungry so I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END> .  I had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  about fifteen  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  to come out and there was only one other customer in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  When the  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  finally arrived  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was cold and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  didn't provide any napkins.  I was thoroughly disappointed and will not go back again.  Now I'm starting to feel sick.

All I can say is the horrible  <START:Service> service <END>  overrode  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  that could possibly have been good about the  <START:Food> food <END> .  The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  of this  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  was very cool and hip and had an abundance of open  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>   <START:S_Seating> seating <END>  which was most welcome coming into phoenix from Michigan winter that same day.  However, our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> not good <END>  at all!  We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> waters <END>  for over 10 mins. and when I needed a refill, because that was all I was drinking, forget about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  I had to flag another  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  down while I could see my  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  rolling silverware.  We were eating with another couple and she never asked if we wanted the bill split either which I thought was unacceptable. Ok...for the  <START:Food> food <END> .  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  verde which was very flavorful and the cornbread that came with  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , I wished I had more of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  My husband had the kale and Brussel sprouts and kale  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  which he thought was very good but the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  were just that, nothing special.  Even with the hen  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> .  The other couple we were with had been here several times and obviously have had much different  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END>  than we had because I don't think I would go back unless  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was for a  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a pretty good looking list and the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area had  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and  <START:A_Places> space <END>  to mingle.

One of my favorite things about Home Plate is that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Type>   family   friendly <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining side <END>  and perfectly " <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> " friendly on the gaming side.  I only wish  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was smoke free on both, but I know that will never happen in Vegas.  Both sides of the  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  (separated by  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  glass  <START:A_Furniture> windows <END> ) have a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  number of  <START:A_Ent_Tv> televisions <END> ... some are a bit outdated and could use an upgrade, but big numbers just the same.  The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining side <END>  also has a small  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> arcade <END>  area which is PERFECT for bringing the kids, especially when the adults would like to hang out for a while, but the kids don't have the attention span to do so.  All of the  <START:Food> food <END>  I have had here (mostly  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ) is excellent and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and good.  Definitely an once/month spot for us and would be more if we lived closer.

I asked for  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  mustard and Delvin over did  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  I asked him to take some of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  off and he looked at  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  like how? I just told him take of the first layer and he did with his glove n  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  got messy.  Then he stick his hands in the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  with the same glove full of mustard. Smh! Then he tells me i have to ask for  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  mustard i said excuse me? Yes I did you didn't hear me.

I consistently have a good  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  when I come here.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is quick and attentive,  <START:Food> food <END>  is good (edamame!) and overall good  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .  We frequent this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  when we want to have a decently  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  teriyaki bowl with  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  is straightforward and tasty.  Plus,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  always have coupons!

For the  <START:W_Price> price <END> ... you can do much better.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was good and the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  was elegant, with amazing  <START:Service> service <END> .  I think of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  as a good date  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  if you have  <START:W_Price> money <END>  to blow and want to try to impress someone.  There are plenty of better  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  to go in Vegas.  Since its in a casino,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't seem to have a dress code, despite its the kind of  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you would expect to have one.  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was nearly  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END>  when we walked in... perhaps that was a clue that we should not have stayed.

Had a solo dinner here at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  while in town for business. First plus, the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  steered me away from a bad  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . Redirected to the drunken sailor, I was a very happy camper after a long day of meetings. I followed  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  up with the  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END> /peach  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>  and was even happier. I am a huge  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>  fan (and make a darn good one). I usually do not like  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END>  varieties but this was intriguing. The two conventioneers next to me slugging Yuengling(don't get me wrong, I like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , but in a Cuban  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ?) were also intrigued.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was tasty and fresh.The  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  had excellent recommendations on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  as well. The Fire and  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  seviche was a winner, providing good  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and some nice heat. The  <START:F_FoodItem> empanada <END>  was a nice follow-up but the seviche starred.  Good  <START:Service> service <END> , good  <START:Food> food <END>  and all at a reasonable  <START:W_Price> price <END> .

Killer  <START:Food> food <END> . I only had one  <START:Food> dish <END>  out of about 12 things I tried that I didn't like.

I love that all of the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  here is fair trade and organic! This is a friendly neighborhood  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END>  which is often filled with families and lots of little kids.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also serve some  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  type  <START:Food> foods <END>  including  <START:F_FoodItem> bagels <END>  and cereal as well as somewhat fancier  <START:Food> lunches <END> . I've had better  <START:F_Drinks> cappuccinos <END>  elsewhere, but  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're acceptable here. Unfortunately, the WiFi is rather hit and miss -- sometimes  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  works and sometimes  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  doesn't, but at least  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's free.

will  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go a few times before bumping to 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> ....but first time was awesome!had to get the LV  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END> ...delicious. that sage  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  rocks. and the dill relish compliments  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  ridiculously well.  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  itself was good, too. paired  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  w/ some cottage  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  w/ cayenne sour cream to dip in and a big cold sprecher root  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , on tap no less. <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has a great looking  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  (good selection of creative dogs, sausages,  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  and sammiches), nice selection of sides ( <START:F_Appetizer>   fried   pickles <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> green   beans   <END> !) and a surprisingly decent  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection (for a  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  grill). plus malts,  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END> , etc.and.... <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have vegetarian options. my girl is vegetarian....want to take her here so she can try a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  refinedReviews! (kinda curious about how a  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  refinedReviews  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  myself....)

Had a very poor  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  there related to customer  <START:Service> service <END> . Arrived to to get  <START:S_Seating> seating <END>  for a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  at 12:30pm.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would not take names and hold  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . There were  <START:S_Menu> limited <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  open at that time, but only two of eight in our party had arrived so  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  wouldn't  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  us.  We mentioned our party was expected around 1.  Around 1  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  started a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  list and were not helpful when we asked to be listed on  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had not looked to save any  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  or opportunities to hold our group and were very rude when we asked again to try and be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> .  The rest of our party showed by 1:15 and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  included 3 kids. At that time, there was nowhere for us to sit.   By 2pm,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had not followed up with us at all or tried to be courteous.  In fact,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were very unprofessional during the entire process.  I complained to the management since  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  "had no idea" about how long  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be to try and  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  us. While I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for more than an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  still made no effort to hold smaller  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  open to try and accommodate our party.  By just after 2pm we said we were leaving and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  seemed shocked.  Was also very frustrated  <START:S_Staff> the manager <END>  did not really try to solve any issues and help us out.  I didn't even get to eat there but my co-workers had  <START:Food> lunch <END>  there other days and said their  <START:Food> meals <END>  were "OK."  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  need to improve their approach to  <START:S_Seating> seating <END>  and customer  <START:Service> service <END> .  If  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would have been more accommodating we would have been a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  party with huge  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> .  Instead,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  ruined our day and their reputation among a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  group of potential customers.

Totally enjoyable, every person that I have taken here is forever a fan of Honey Pig!The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Brisket and Bulgogi are sooooooooooooo good!!!

Fun  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  and pretty good  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was great, we kept having people join our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were very accommodating.

I LOVE the  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  here! I've been coming here every other weekend since moving to Montreal! The  <START:Service> service <END>  is quick and friendly. The  <START:S_Seating> seating <END>  is casual, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a huge variety of chocolates at the front to purchase! I work nearby so I come here often to grab  <START:Food> lunch <END> , or a chocolate snack. The  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  is only served on weekends! I highly recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . I would come again and again! <START:Food> food <END>  -  Amazing! <START:Service> service <END>  - Friendly and quickAmbiance - CasualWorth the  <START:W_Price> money <END>  - Yes!

My favorite bistro in all of Montreal. From the great hors d'oeuvres to the fabulous  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END> , this is a spot you just can't afford to miss. Located in the French quarter, l'express is a small  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  that is lays packed and full of eclectic people.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is amazing but be sure to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  l'ile flottante before  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sell out and don't forget the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  to finish off the evening.

Terrible  <START:Service> service <END> , very pretentious  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for my  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  for 20 min once and in the end  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  turned out  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  forgot ! Sold me a day old  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END> ...

My wife and I first went to the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  on Rea Road twice and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was fantastic both times! We came to this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's closer to us and because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a chain, we thought the  <START:Food> food <END>  would be just as good as the one on Rea Road. We were severely disappointed.

 <START:Restaurant> it <END>  an okay  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go for pho... Nothing "wow" factor....  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  was more  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  and not enough  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> ... Not to mention very little herbs given

As I've always wanted to go here, my fiancé surprised me by taking me the The Witchery for my birthday this evening. Maybe I came in with incredibly high expectations but I found that the hype of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  far outweighs what you get. I was not particularly  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with any  <START:Food> dish <END>  I received, to be completely honest. While the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is not "bad" by any means,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seems as though  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's coasting on a name, rather than the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END> . The Witchery seems to do  <START:Food> food <END>  that is very classic, which is great if that's what you're looking for. However, I was expecting the classic  <START:Food> food <END>  to have something which set  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  apart from other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . In short, I saw nothing like that and was served a few fancy looking  <START:Food> dishes <END>  that were not nearly the calibre of  <START:Food> food <END>  I would expect from a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  this "legendary" or in such a  <START:W_Price> price <END>  point. I have eaten at several world class  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  and have experienced better  <START:Food> dishes <END>  at a fraction of the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  in more cosmopolitan hubs (Vegas, NYC, etc). Not only that, but I found the  <START:Service> service <END>  to be dismal overall. The  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were very kind but not attentive enough. I recognize that there can be a cultural divide between American (which I find far too hands on) and British  <START:Service> service <END>  but this didn't even begin to straddle the line. We were left to our own devices with only a check in every half  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  (if that). The last straw, which I'm not sure was intentional or not, was that I wasn't asked if i wanted my credit card charge to be in dollars or pounds. For most people this isn't a big deal, but I travel enough to know that establishments make extra  <START:W_Price> money <END>  if one  <START:O_Payment> pays <END>  in foreign currency...I would think a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  of this calibre would know exactly what  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are doing when hey run something like that, which I find dishonest. The Witchery gets extra points for acknowledging and doing something sweet for my birthday but overall, I'd recommend people look to other  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  in Edinburgh for great  <START:Food> food <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  seems like a tourist trap that's lazy bc of their legacy. Personally, I felt  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a waste of  <START:W_Price> money <END> .

So I've never had Vietnamese Pho before (pronounced fu, as in fun, without the n) and I decided to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with a friend of mine who speaks Vietnamese and would be able to tell me what to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and what I was eating and also steer me to the best  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in town so I'd have a positive initial Pho  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and want to go back again and again.unPHOgettable is tucked into an Asian cultural center just south of Main Street on Dobson on the west side of the road and is part of the Asian grocery story, but has  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's own entrance and  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> eating area <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had a pretty nice  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  was very helpful and even recognized my friend and his wife as we walked in (I figured  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  either eat there quite a bit, or the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  remembers him because he doesn't likely see very many tall, geeky, white kids who speak Vietnamese). The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  had a very wide selection and did a decent job of explaining what each of the items are. The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  offered to go over the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  with us, since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was our first time, but my friend told him that he would handle  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was pretty clean and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very helpful. My only minor complaint was that there was a minor  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  odor in the  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END> , but I wasn't quite sure if  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> 's  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  or the adjoining Asian grocery store that had the fishy smell. Either way  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't overpowering and didn't detract from our  <START:Food> meal <END>  at all.I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  Pho with  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tendon <END> . I have to admit, that when I looked at the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , I thought  <START:F_FoodItem> tendon <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> tenderloin <END> , so I assumed I was  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  strips of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  junks.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't until my friend's wife repeated my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  with an emphasis on  <START:F_FoodItem> tendon <END>  that I realized what I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . Either way though, I'm pretty adventurous so I figured I'd give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a shot. My wife  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a flat  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  instead of the  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  since she's had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  before. The  <START:Food> food <END>  didn't take long and we were brought our enormous bowls of Pho with all the trimmings. I added a decent  <START:F_FI_Size> amount <END>  of hoisen  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , and an even more decent  <START:F_FI_Size> amount <END>  of hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The broth in my bowl actually ended up pretty dark red. I added in my  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts, tore up my  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  and plopped in my jalapeños to boot. I dug in and was amazed at how great  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> . I wasn't really amazed that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  good, but that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  SO good AND I'd never had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  before. Why had people kept this a secret from me?  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was fantastic and right up my alley.  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> , hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> . I wolfed mine down and even tried my wife's  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> dish <END> , not really enough to give a thorough review, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was good, and I'd try  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  again.The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  weren't bad, I ended up  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  about $22 for the two of us to eat our  <START:Food> meals <END>  and a small  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  split between 4 people. Range: $7.50 - $12.00.Sorry for posting without pictures, but I'm sure I'll be back and append some pics to this after my next bowl.Because of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , I am now a fan of Vietnamese  <START:Food> food <END> , specifically the Pho  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .Rating: 5.0http://dietstartstomorrow.com/post/2982603033/unphogettable-mesa

This will be my first visit to a Korean BBQ joint here in Vegas and I was delightfully surprised.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was fairly traditional with a decent selection (tripe was a nice addition). The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was attentive as  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  needed to be; quick to switch out grill tops and refill  <START:F_Drinks> waters <END> , but that is rarely a deal-breaker for me at these  <START:Restaurant> places <END> . To explain to those that may have been to different style Korean BBQ's, this is the type that is  <START:Food> buffet <END>  style, not the dim sum style. I typically compare Korean  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  on their kalbi, and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  stacks up right around the 3  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  range. Having been to, in my opinion, some of the best domestic Korean BBQ's back in Queens, NY, this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  filled the void rather nicely. I'll definitely return for my monthly dose of pig intestine, And for 18$ a head? Gun bae!

I came upon Paradise Bakery by chance and just stopped by to have a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and something sweet. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a caramel  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> snickerdoodle cookie <END> , and a  <START:F_Dessert> sugar cookie <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all okay, but not fantastic. I think  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a little pricey for what  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is. The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END>  was pretty nice and seemed like a nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to study or read, but I probably wouldn't choose to go back.

This a great deli, by airports standards or otherwise.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a fairly  <START:S_Menu> limited <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  There are  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> wraps <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , and fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  is always friendly and prompt, which is great when you're rushing to a flight. Try the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  and cranberry  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is great! This is my go to for a quick  <START:Food> meal <END>  before heading to the security line.

 <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  were good but apparently  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  didn't want to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  the rent.  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is closed, locked up with a sign saying the lien holder has taken over. Guess I have to find a new  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  now. Damnit.

Went here to break Passover this yearWhat we sampled:  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  sampler      Definitely a good way to try different  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> , to get an idea of what you like. I was really interested in the Hefeweizen with  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  of banana and clove.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was definitely interesting smelled like bananas and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like cloves.  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  sample     The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and pretzels were great and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sauerkraut balls <END>  were definitely interesting.  I wasn't such a big fan of the potato  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  though.  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  spatzel     Total winner of the night.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was awesome. Apple Streudel     A classic, though I don't know if I would  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  again.  Not really my thing.  <START:Service> service <END>  was great and helpful!

Good Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  good a little on the spicey side. Kind of small could've been bigger. Good   <START:Service> service <END> .

Good  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> , but like a previous comment,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  gets harder and harder to keep going back.  The way  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  process  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  is annoying, but that's not a deal-breaker if the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  I've  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  mostly.   <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>   <START:W_Price> cost <END>  extra.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  isn't remarkable.  Overall the  <START:Food> food <END>  is just okay - good enough to stop by if  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's on the way to somewhere else -  <START:O_Experience> not good <END>  enough to make a trip specifically to dine there.

I was really unimpressed.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  get a weak 3 based mainly on the  <START:Service> service <END>  which was the strong point of the visit this morning.Arriving about 8 on a Thursday morning the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was about full.  Given the choice between a booth and the counter I chose a booth.   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  decaf which there was afresh pot brewing and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came in a few  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Country  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  (normally $5.99 but was the daily special at $4.99) with 2  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> , a split biscuit with gravy and 2 slices of  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> .The  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  were ok.  I prefer a sausage gravy rather than the  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  gravy  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  make but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was ok.  The  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  was tasty but  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  and not lean.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  were runny in the middle.The building and  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  was showing a lot of wear.  There ware a lot of regulars even after the morning rush of folks heading off to work.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was really good and friendly.Overall this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was a reasonable value in that you could get a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  at fast  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END>  with  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:Service> service <END> .  Not sure I would make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  part of a regular rotation but I may stop again because of where  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is in relation to where I travel.

I used to think Sephora was my "Happy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ," but that was until I went to Hough's.  Hough's is my happy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , and also you can't  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  at Sephora.So.Many. <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> !  At reasonable  <START:W_Price> prices <END> !!!  Every time I leave the Sharp Edge I feel like I've left the bulk of my personal wealth there.  Not at Hough's!   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  that's good about the Sharp Edge, and you're not going to go broke.I also really liked that the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  list was seperated by brewery, bc I am a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  snob.  Not a fan of Dogfish, but I do love my Troeg's.  I also really liked that on the back of the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer descriptions of each of the different  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  so you can sound like you know what the hell you are talking about when discussing the random  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  you've just  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> .  "I like the fruity finish of this Kolsch.  I believe this brewery is from a small basement in a small upstate NewYork town you've never heard of!"Pro tip:   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's winter.   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a black IPA or a Winter Warmer, don't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a Kolsch.  Ever.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are just  <START:O_Experience> not good <END> .My current favorite  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  at Hough's is 21st Ammendment Fireside Chat.  Try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  You'll love  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  is my "thing" and I know what's up.  You'll like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , trust me.  I had a lot of  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were good.  The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was knowledgeable, and according to my friend (a  <START:S_Staff> guy <END> ), she was also hot.  He appreciated that.The only thing I didn't like was the cold  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  dip.  There are certain  <START:Food> foods <END>  I call, " <START:S_Staff> guy <END>   <START:Food> foods <END> ."  Stuff  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  love and chicks are grossed out by.  This was one of them, bc my friend ate the whole thing while I poked at  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and said, "Is this just a block of cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  with shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  mixed in?"  I'm pretty sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was.  But my friend loved  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .I'll def be back, and you should go there too!

Ate here on our trip to Vegas last year using a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .com certificate.  Gotta love the  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  that let you include liquor the coupon.  We each had a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>  that was delicious and not weak.  We shared the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  nachos that were excellent.  Shared a couple other  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  that also hit the mark well.  A bit small of a  <START:A_Places> space <END>  and you get to know your neighbors well.  Great deal with the certificate.

Well call me Sheila and throw another  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  on that barbie. Ok, so there's no Australian connection to Treacle, but the King Prawn  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  box I had here today was by far the best  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , and the best EVER  <START:F_FoodItem> king   prawns   <END> , I've ever had. We're talking about all my culinary dining  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END>  internationally here, and I've done all the whole med- <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  scene ample times.The  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were fresh off the barbie, really charred and flavoursome and juicy and mmm. Seriously, just...if you like  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END> , go and  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  that  <START:Food> dish <END> . I want another one now, and I only had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  3 hours ago. As far as  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  go  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was better than any chinese takeaway I've had too. So, as far as my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of Treacle goes,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a pub and a gastro-pub, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is exceptional. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  doesn't give that away.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has the standard pies,  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , open  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  etc. and doesn't seem to hint that  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 'll be anything other than good pub  <START:Food> food <END> . But ohmylord.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  I've had here has just been exceptionally well  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  deserves every single one of these 5 sexy  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .I can't recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  highly enough for delicious pub grub. Read my other reviews of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  previously for an idea of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I am now definitely one of its biggest fans.

This is one of my all time favorite  <START:Food> lunch <END>  spots near my work. My girlfriend introduced this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to me a few months ago when I was craving Viet  <START:Food> food <END> . She encouraged me to try the bahn mi  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .  I immediately fell in love. As I got to explore the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .. I quickly found this spot to have some the best pho I've ever had.. from living in California to now recently residing in Vegas. The rare  <START:F_FoodItem> flank <END>  is awesome especially when you get  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  served on the side instead of already mixed in the broth allows you to drop in at your leisure to get soft "rare" slices of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> .  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .. very flavourful! ..Great cure for hangovers! I really enjoy the bbq  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  and the spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are amazing (always fresh). The peanut dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  for the spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  is definitely on point and is a must try if you eat here. Also the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are very reasonable and just a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for friends and  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  to get good local Vietnamese  <START:Food> food <END> !

I was really  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  at Sage Garden!  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  catered a meeting for us and  I thought their  <START:Food> food <END>  really stood out: <START:S_Staff> they <END>  came in (on time) and set  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  all up for us in a timely/professional manner (as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a working  <START:Food> lunch <END> ) <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> - Excellent, I had  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  & swiss although  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , ham, and I believe roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  to choose from.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all served on soft croissant  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> .  A veg option would have been great and some individual mustard/mayo's rather than a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  one for all to share ( the germaphobe in me would have appreciated  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .) <START:S_Staff> they <END>  provided potato  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  which was DELICIOUS! Red  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> , green  <START:F_Ingredients> onion <END> , mayo -based, non-sweet, with almost a hint of  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was really good.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also gave us some incredible chocolate brownies, which were just so good I wish I grabbed one more before I left. Overall the  <START:Food> food <END>  was really delicious-  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were a step above many of the other franchised options. Fresh and tasty, just the way I like my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to be : ) I'd highly recommend them.

Of Wolfley and Man! (Metallica Reference!)I came here for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with an associate and I wanted to try something new. Wolfley's was definitely something you can't find anywhere in the country so what the hey! I would have  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  their hometown favorite roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , but the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  warned me  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was quite salty.  I'm glad she did since I don't take kindly on overly salty  <START:Food> foods <END> . So I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheeseburger <END>  sliders instead. Let's just say I wasn't sure if should have sucked  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  up and tried the roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  instead. Sliders were, well sub par and basic.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty dry and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came along with some  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> onion <END>  flakes. I needed to douse  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with some ketchup to help me swallow  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . My  <START:Food> meal <END>  also came along with a side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , which was probably the better of the two. However, I found a few brown leaves and tried to work around  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was good overall and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was pretty well put together. Definitely a cool  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to hang with the boys for a  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> . I went on Wolfey's website and notice  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are fond of charitable work and non-profits coming to their  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  - Kudos! Then again in my honest opinion I'm not sure I would want to recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  unless  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just for  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . - Enjoy!

The strip mall exterior belies the treasure within! When you enter, you're immediately  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  by the smell of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . Normally the smell of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  is not a pleasant one for me. As in, makes me lose my appetite. So,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a huge compliment when I say, the smells coming out of the open  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  are mouthwatering. When one of my dining companions received her  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END> , there were yet more mouthwatering aromas. WTH kind of alchemy is going on in that  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  make this vegetarian salivate over dead animal? No matter, fellow lovers of the plant plate, there's options for you here. For starters, you *must*  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the Brussels sprouts ( <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do come with panchetta, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  can be left off). DIEvine. Seriously. As are the roasted root  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> . I love when something simple is so delicious.I normally never eat mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's so two-note (duh), but Beckett's  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  makes  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  so that I finally *get* why people are all gaga over this stuff.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's very subtle, but those mustard seeds take the  <START:Food> dish <END>  to a whole other level of delish bliss. My  <START:Food> entree <END> , the oven roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  tower was probably the least exciting thing I ate last night night, but still flavorful in its own right and beautifully plated. I'm just not a fan of roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  which comprise about half of the stack. I'll leave this tiny meh at that, because the entire  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  blows that away into the ether. Next up,  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . Although thoroughly stuffed at this point, I managed a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of the sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> potato pie <END>  (incredible), the  <START:F_FoodItem> berry cobbler <END>  (delightfully tart, balanced with a sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream) and the piéce de resistance, fig (yes, I said fig) and  <START:F_FoodItem> pecan pie <END> .I'd be remiss to not mention the  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  list, which seemed quite creative.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was hard for me to choose, but I had the Az Farmhand, which has Hendricks gin,  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> , ginger,  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END>  and honey, many of my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  did not disappoint. Fabulous selection of wines by the glass, too.A thoroughly lovely  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  from start to finish, Beckett's  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  provides top notch  <START:Food> food <END>  at affordable  <START:W_Price> prices <END> , with impeccable  <START:Service> service <END>  in a rustic  <START:A_Environment> environment <END>  (you feel like you're in the hippest, coziest lodge).

Too bad the  <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> schmear <END>  were delicious, because the  <START:Service> service <END>  was terrible. When I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  my  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  +  <START:F_FoodItem> matzo <END>  ball (which was alright but not  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  $5.99) I asked for  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  in the plastic container to go, I was argued with, being told the paper like container was more safe and better for  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> ... <START:Restaurant> it <END>  promptly spilled because the lid wasn't tight enough, and in my car.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  looks amazing when you walk in and feel like you have entered a 70's  <START:Food> diner <END> . Then the longer you spend there the less amazing  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  became. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is terrible and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took forever to get our  <START:Food> food <END> . I made my own  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  but found the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  has no seasoning at all, just  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  made into a patty and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were not bad but the mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> not good <END>  at all,  one  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  was enough for me. The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  looked good but i am sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was like most of the stuff in this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Looks great but leaves a bad  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in your mouth.

We initially wanted to go to Wicked Spoon for the  <START:Food> buffet <END> , but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were about to close to prepare for dinner. We saw Holsteins along the way and decided to check  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out. We both got the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , which was okay. My son enjoyed the  <START:F_FoodItem> mini sliders <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent, but maybe a bit overpriced, mostly likely due to  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  in the Cosmo. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was fantastic and really catered to our kids needs.

 <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty much all  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  and barely any  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> . My boyfriend got sick from the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  he had. Won't go back.

This was hands down the best  <START:Food> meal <END>  I had during my recent trip to Phoenix.Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was very friendly and helpful - walking us through the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , making suggestions, and just being overall very pleasant.My husband and I started with the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Belly Pastrami, which was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and delicious.  We scarfed down the whole thing.For  <START:Food> entrees <END> , I went with the  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  were nicely prepared, but I could have eaten a whole bowl of just the  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> . Mm - so so good.My husband had the  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END>  which were definitely the right way to go.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were delicious.And, even though we were both too full to move, I really wanted to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  pudding, so we went for  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  So.  <START:W_Price> worth <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  The only unfortunate thing was that at 8:00 on the Sunday night before Columbus day, the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was pretty much  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END> .  I would have expected more of a  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  felt a little ... i don't know..not happening. But, despite the lack of a  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END> , this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  stands on its  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in AZ

Amazing little  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> !  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have some seriously wonderful  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> . You can't go wrong with the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  board, the  <START:F_FoodItem> flatbreads <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> charcuterie board <END> , or the  <START:F_FoodItem> warm brie <END> ...  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're all to die for! OH, the  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END>  are great too! I wasn't thrilled with the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END>  to be honest, but that was my only disappointment. One more thing I was simply so bummed about was  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  discontinued the rock  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and that was my FAVORITE. I still ask every time I go in just to see if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  will bring  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back. :) You just cannot beat the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection, the delicious  <START:Food> food <END> , and the great  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> . This is a must try!

I was driving down Buffalo and came across this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  Boy am I glad I stopped by.OMG! This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is the bomb diggity! Never expected the  <START:Food> food <END>  to be so delicious!   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's like an explosion of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  in your mouth! The red  <START:F_FoodItem> velvet pancake <END>  is to die for. I'm from Hawaii so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a surprise to see Hawaiian  <START:Food> dishes <END>  served here.  To all the Hawaiians in Las Vegas this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  give Cinnamons  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  HARD RUBS! Plus  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  serve Zippy's Chilli here!!! I tried the Adobe  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  Omelette and the Kailua Pig Benedict! A+ in my books!The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was wonderful! Very friendly and very prompt.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  filled our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  when needed and provided a smile every time  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  came by.  I know this is random but their  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  was so good! Very Cold and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  fresh! That is also a plus for me when checking out a new  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  as you know you don't always want to get  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . So rest assured if you want  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  here your gonna have a good one.  <START:W_Price> price <END>  is very reasonable for the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  your are going to receive.  The  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are more than decent to get you full and possible end up taking some to go!I had a great overall  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  as a first timer.  I don't live next to this area but with the results of having a friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , amazing  <START:Food> food <END> , and decent  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  I will not hesitate to take a drive to eat here again!

First visit to Emzy last weekend and my wife and I loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a little weird when we arrived around 7:45 on a Saturday night and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was dead. I was worried the  <START:Food> food <END>  might not be good, but I have to say that  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was great! We both eat  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  all the time and we had some of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  here at Emzy. I am not sure why the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was packed out with patrons. The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is trendy and cool, the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly and the  <START:Food> food <END>  great. I have to assume that the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , not near Trade and Tryon or the Epicenter, are the only reason  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was mostly  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END> . Well, that is a shame. If you like  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is not to be missed. We loved the Drunken  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> , and especially loved the Sweet 18  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a bit pricey at $16, but the Sweet 18 was  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  every  <START:W_Price> penny <END> ! The  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>  Tuna Ball small plate was excellent as well. If you're a fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , I would recommend Emzy for sure!

I got the three  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  on my first time here. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  was just wonderful.

This is the 3rd  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  I've tried out.  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  Jungle does NOT disappoint!  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  about their  <START:Food> food <END>  is consistent. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly. I wish we had these  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Florida.  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> five   stars   <END> !

I am a native Phoenician and Mexican American. I was shocked to find this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  serving such authentic Mexican  <START:Food> dishes <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was similar to my Mother's cooking. Try the seafood with Mojo de Ajo ( <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ).  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  added peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  to the Mojo de Ajo and this was truly a delicacy know  to very few locals.Try the Dos Amigos ( <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END> ) - $13.25. The  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>  are the 2  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>   Man and Wife. Beautiful  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  and very pleasant young  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END> /waitresses  12-29-12  looking forward to 2013

Amazing pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ! The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was charred and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  just right. The sides are huge  <START:A_Places> portions <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> poutine <END>  was pretty tasty but not enough  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ! More  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just right.

45  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for undercooked  <START:F_FoodItem> macaroni <END>  (so called tiger  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> )  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  platter came with plastic wrap around pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  my favorite  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  had literally 10% of liquor and the rest was  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   ...wanted to impress my boyfriend with some classy Italian  <START:Food> food <END> , so I did!

Favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  in Charlotte. If I hadn't lived in Chicago previously, I might say my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  ever. I love the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  both  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END>  and out, but you can't beat the rooftop deck. With this building's bad reputation for keeping tenants, I hope JJ's can make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  for the long haul. I'm a big fan.

The  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  must be doing something right, since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was crowded.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was acceptable, but not exceptional.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  (Maple  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  and Tiramisu) were  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  with topping on top, not wrapped within as one normally does for a  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> .  We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  or so for the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  to come out, and the presentation of the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  seemed rushed--toppings were just sort of dumped on top of the folded  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> , like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was prepared by someone in a rush.  I suspect  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did not have a  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  floorspace or  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  adequate to meet demand.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly and considerate and the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  was pleasant.  While not terrible,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was not really  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  or the  <START:W_Price> price <END> .  I doubt I will go back.

Bacchanal  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is located at Ceasars Palace.I'm a victim of expecting a grand feast from this mega  <START:Food> buffet <END> , only to have my expectations shattered like a huge mirror hitting a concrete floor. Fellow Yelpers raved about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and friends that had gone, had also raved about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . So naturally I bookmarked  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and anxiously awaited my time to feast like a king at the " <START:Food> buffet <END>  of all  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END> ."Upon arriving at the entrance to the  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was already clear that we came during the dinner rush. The line was insanely long.  Fast forward 1.5 hours later and we were finally  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>   <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END> ....oh yes,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took us 1.5 hours of  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  & $50+ per person to get in. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is freaking huge.  <START:Food> food <END>  on  <START:Food> food <END>  on  <START:Food> food <END>  &  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  on  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  on  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  was pretty and oozed of opulence for a  <START:Food> buffet <END> . We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  relatively close to the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  station. The entire  <START:Food> meal <END>  was a blur, there was a lot to choose from ( <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END> , ethnic  <START:Food> foods <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> , sides,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , soups, etc) and yet nothing specific comes to mind about what was the best at that  <START:Food> buffet <END> . However, I did enjoy the crab legs and the choice of either cold crab legs or boiled crab legs; which were boiled fresh upon each  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . The only thing I didn't like about Bacchanal was the  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Ambience> set up <END> . The majority of the  <START:Food> food <END>  stations and the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  station were located in the same  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> ; but the crab legs and the majority of the Asian  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  were located in a separate  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> . I suppose this is my  <START:Food> buffet <END>  pet peeve and the worst offender is the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  at Mandalay Bay, where the majority of each  <START:Food> food <END>  station is sectioned off in its own  <START:A_Places> space <END> @!&$# LOL I digress. I'm pretty sure the long  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  left a bad  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in my mouth making my expectation of the Bacchanal that much more important. Would I come back to Bacchanal? Yes, to give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  another shot, BUT will need to time my next visit so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  doesn't coincide during the rush -_-

We had tickets to the Mercury  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and were trying to get away from the crowds when we stumbled upon this amazing little  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END> !We both had chubby  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  with ranch  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> . I also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  an Oreo Shake. Prepare to be wowed. I don't know what  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is about this  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is an  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  to eat  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . Plenty of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  mixed with the freshness of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and soft  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END>  whole grain  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ....well  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just indescribable and also very affordable!You need to visit soon!

Decided to go here instead of my normal Chipotle fix. I had the roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  club., <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was loaded with  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  but definitely not eat. Just a few slices of each and maybe  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was hard to tell under all he  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was really tasty, seemed fresh! The   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  was just over $9. A bit pricey for what you get. There are some other  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  shops motto far from here that have better  <START:Food> food <END>  at a better  <START:W_Price> price <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seems this store just opened. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is prepared super fast. I will give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  another trying few weeks to see if this was just a new opening hiccup.

We just came from having the BEST  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  we have ever eaten.  We had the Sicilian and added artichokes.  Unbelievably delicious, Artisan style and fresh.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was wonderful.  The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> / <START:S_Staff> cook <END>  and entire  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  made their way over to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  just to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  us.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sell homemade french  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and rosemary/kalamata  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>  french  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  Took two loaves home.  Don't listen to one word negative about the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  or  <START:Food> food <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  really was delightful. fyi:  to Lenne O from Denver...  You must have been in the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  across the  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot because 1)you do not serve your own beverage  2) there isn't a chalkboard and 3) you don't prepay or pre-tip.  None of that...

The  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  here was average. I went with a healthier option on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and did not get my  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END> , I got the kabobs. There was nothing special about the  <START:Food> dish <END>  BUT the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  properly. I would go back here and try something different. Also great  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  from Forest Gump!!!

You'll feel like you're eating in a Havana Bistro with a Cuba Libre on the side and expect a hand  <START:F_FoodItem> rolled <END>  cuban cigar to follow your  <START:Food> meal <END>  under palm trees.  Which leaves one massive mystery: I've never seen a cuban cooking, serving,  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , or eating there.  I'm not sure a cuban has ever so much as walked by Saluds door.  Yet, magically,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was teleported over from Fidel Castro's personal  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  right to your Pittsburgh plate.Incredibly fresh  <START:Food> dishes <END> , high on  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was genuine and warm, and the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  even offered us holiday  <START:F_Appetizer> cookies <END>  his wife made as a  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>  for free just to be friendly.  The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is totally standard Lawrenceville/Pittsburgh  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , and has no hint of the cuban  <START:F_FI_Taste> deliciousness <END>  that is conjured up in their  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a solid craft brew list with a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  number of rotating bottles and drafts, and reasonable  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  across the board.I'd love to see the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  match the excellent cuban  <START:Food> food <END>  and strong  <START:Service> service <END> , but I'd gladly come back either way.  For great cuban  <START:Food> food <END>  at great  <START:W_Price> prices <END> , Salud, I salute you!

I decided to come here after driving past  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  so many times. The first thing I noticed was their dull  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , no creativity what so ever. I'm a graphic designer so for me precentation means a lot. Anyway, I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> tripa <END>  and an  <START:F_FoodItem> al pastor <END> . I was the only one there, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took them a good five  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to prepare them. Not only that,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  messed up my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  gave me a  <START:F_FoodItem> cabeza <END>  instead of  <START:F_FoodItem> tripa <END> . Very disappointed. If I ever come back I'll know what to expect.

I really wanted to love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ....especially from the good reviews and because we drove from Henderson just to go and eat here (about 45 minute drive).  We went for  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  on a Sunday and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  did not seem too busy.  There were plenty of  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  available and there was a small line to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  take your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  at one counter and then you  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in line to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  at another counter. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and then stood in line for about 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  before we could even  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  The  <START:Ambience> set up <END>  is just not expeditious in any way.  We got a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for our  <START:Food> food <END> .  There were four of us; 2 people in our party received their  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in about 35  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> ....the other 2 received their  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in about 50  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .....which was over an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  from when we first made our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a Benedict and a 3  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  (total).....so over an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  seems completely unacceptable to me for such a small and simple  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  The Pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Benedict was good and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was nicely  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END>  but their Cuban  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was flavorless.  I was so hoping that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be good enough for the  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  plus  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> ....but I was really disappointed.  We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a side of  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> ...but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a small plate of about 10  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END> , small slices.  The portion was really small for a  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  side  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were also MEH.....nothing special and no seasonings or herbs at all.  To be honest, I would not make the trip across town again with so many better options.

My wife and I just happened to be at Starbucks when we decide to try Taco Guild. Once arriving we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  very quickly. Unfortunately  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was at a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  that hadn't  been cleaned (kinda gross if you'd ask me) which shows a lack of communication between who ever is cleaning the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and who ever is sitting them (or  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  couldn't care less where  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sat my wife and I). The  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and chairs are booth style so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a bit uncomfortable for me. The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was very nice and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  us very warmly. Unfortunately (and I might attribute this to a busy night on his end) we weren't really told about the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Once the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  left my wife and I felt as if we knew nothing more about Taco Guild then when we sat down, this could have been excused if this  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  had been open for a couple of months but this was the third night  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was opened. All in all the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was great  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came out quick and hot and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  seemed to have adjusted better and was accessible more and more throughout our  <START:Food> meal <END> . I recommend the Taco Guild the  <START:Food> food <END>  was great at the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is killer and I'm very excited to see if there are any sports nights or weekends coming up at Taco Guild. If you're a selective eater please make sure to ask questions (next time I'll take my own advice as well). Please see below for a personal side note...*The  <START:Food> meal <END>  went fine and I seldom felt a I need to call my  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  over. As we were leaving a man which I presumed worked there (he was standing around looking at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and standing with the host and what I assumed to be the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ...or maybe he was the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ) went to the door and held  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  open. What I hadn't realized was that he was holding  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  open for a couple (white and in there 50's maybe) coming in and not for my wife and I (Hispanic and white respectably) which were going out. The man after noticing my wife and I motioning towards the door continues to motion the couple which was entering to come in. Awkward at best this situation left a poor  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in my mouth.

Great  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  but bad  <START:Service> service <END> .  Sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and pretty much had the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  thrown at me.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took about ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  to notice me after I had a chance to review the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was my first time there and probably my last. Sucks because I was really excited about going there.

back already!  My husband had the really  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  combo, and I had a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  enchilada and  <START:F_FoodItem> taco combo <END> .. I must admit, the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was really tasty.   <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END> , but not overpowering.  the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was not really that  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  say all their  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END> .Next time, I'll get the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  too.good  <START:Food> food <END> , smiling  <START:Service> service <END> , clean  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .

I have to admit, I wasn't particularly adventurous with my  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  when I ate here last week. We arrived around 12:30 and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was pretty busy.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are still offering their regular  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  for 50% off so I got a few off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  to try. My dining companion  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:Food> lunch <END>  special, which was also a pretty good deal. The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  was all pretty fresh and the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were made well. I would have given them 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  if  <START:Service> service <END>  was a bit better. I know  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were a little busy, but  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  went unfilled and our  <START:Food> food <END>  came out slow. Their AYCE  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were reasonable and I have a Groupon burning a hole in my pocket, so I will be back. Looking forward to trying more items off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Both the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  items look enticing.

The  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  are extremely nice and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is quite delicious. Nice, Authentic, and a great  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of the Middle East.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  absolutely lives up to its  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> ! Amazing  <START:Food> food <END> , amazing  <START:Service> service <END> , and adorable pens shaped like chopsticks holding nigiri :P The special with sea bass and  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>  salt was my favorite, but the trout with pop rocks and the tadas were amazing too.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  we has was fresh and delicious. But whatever you do, don't ask for Louis... He's mine!

I've been to Pomo for several company outings and for dinner dates. The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  never wavers whether I'm there with two people or twenty -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is always an excellent visit with knowledgable  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  and delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> . Any of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  are absolutely delicious as well, I wouldn't hesitate trying a new option here at all. Definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  a visit, don't miss the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  in cooler weather!

Clean and friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . Had the Dac Biet  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  and spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . Overall, tasty, would recommend to an out of towner as a safe bet. Hits the pho craving you just have to add your own spices/sriracha.

Love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !!!  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have lots of gluten free options and I think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are  <START:O_Pay_Price> priced <END>  well! I go in at least once a week for their  <START:F_FoodItem> broccoli <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> !!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's the best I have ever had!! And I alway have great  <START:Service> service <END> !

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  might become my new go to  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  I went in for the first time since the remodel and was extremely  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> .  The whole  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  feels wry opened and bright and clean.  With the number of TVs  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have all around the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  this is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to watch football. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great, our  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  knew the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  well and gave us some great recommendations.  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  pretzels to start and I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  cesar melt.   <START:Food> food <END>  came out fast and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was delicious. I'll definitely be back here.
