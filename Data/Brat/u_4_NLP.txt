I had  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  yesterday before the Pirates  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  with a few friends.  I have also been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a few times upstairs.  I really liked the fact that we had no problem getting a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  or a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .  I usually go to the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>  on the North Shore prior to Pirates  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> , but this was a lot less  <START:Ambience> crowded <END>  and good for the group I was with.  In fact, truth be told the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was only about 1/2 full (on Bucs opening day!?).  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was okay.  I tried these  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  which were good and interesting because it had a decent  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  as the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and not just ground  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> .  I also really liked the sweet  <START:F_FoodItem>   potato     fries   <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and you usually can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  get these at too many places.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> .  It was a ton of  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> , however some of the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  was a little  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> overcooked <END>  and it was  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cold.  I can understand serving cool even though Id prefer  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END> , but  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cold really wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  that good when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  on it.  I also tried the  <START:F_Appetizer> tortilla   soup   <END> , which was really rich and had a good  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  The only thing missing in the  <START:F_Appetizer> tortilla   soup   <END>  was the  <START:F_FoodItem> tortilla   chips   <END> .  A minor oversight I imagine.  Overall, a pretty decent  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  when you are looking to just have a few  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  with friends.  I've also tried the upstairs  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  which is the more upscale section.  The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  which is good plenty of room, and their is plenty of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  including  <START:A_Furniture> leather couches <END> .  The  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>  is okay, but it's pretty much a ghosttown after 8 PM.  Overall a decent  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for quiet  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  without the crowds and a little better than average  <START:Food> food <END> .

We sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and only ate  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END> , but all-in-all it was an excellent  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> !  Craig and the other  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  (sorry i forgot her name... <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was very sweet) were on top of it, and  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent. The  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were good too.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  made our Charlotte  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  better. Thanks!

I just had  <START:Food> lunch <END>  at the Phoenix City Grille. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good, but the  <START:Service> service <END>  was not the best.  I got the Green Chile  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , and it was pretty good. We were  <START:Service> served <END>  quickly, but the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  come check on us for several minutes. I needed  <START:F_Ingredients> mayonnaise <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , but I had to wait at least  <START:S_Del_Time> 10 minutes <END>  for the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  to return to ask for it. I also had a  <START:F_Drinks> mimosa <END> . It was good, but the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  never asked if I  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> cared <END>  for another. The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  only asked me if I wanted more  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  when it was  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to leave the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  It also seemed to take awhile to get the check and  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for the  <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was only moderately busy, and it seems like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  only had a few  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  working. I really don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  fault the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> . It just seems like  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was waiting on too many people.

Very nice  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  excellent  <START:Food> food <END>  and a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to see live bands

************The  <START:Food> dinner <END>  plates are .......  a Good Value**************          The  <START:Food> dinner <END>  Plates come with a Nice Size Greek  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with Feta  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .          Plus a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  or French  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and Pita  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .      We've eaten  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  three times ...... the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  was disappointing.The last two times .......... HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING.The  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  are very generous .....and the seasoning RIGHT ON.                             My Wife enjoyed her Kabob ......                     My Gyros ...... the best I've had in Arizona

Of course if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  claim to have the best  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> -I had to try them. I liked the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , nice  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  pieces, deep  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END> , not too heavy on the  <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END> . Although I found the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  a bit dry, and I didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  think their  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was  <START:Food> anything <END>  special-but at least  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ! I asked for just the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  charged me and gave me the entire  <START:Food> meal <END> , therefore only three stars...and my search for  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  continues.

We went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for our anniversary tonight . I havent ate a red  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  for 10 years because of how gross it was! But we decided it was  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  again after reentering the real world ( we justed moved back from the bush alaska) . And to tell you it wasnt bad at all. I really enjoyed my  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> ! And my  <START:F_Drinks> alcoholic   drink   <END>  actually had alcohol in it

Ok, so I've never been a fan of Domino's in the past and I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  say much has changed since  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had redone their recipe for a "better"  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>  is just too overly seasoned. That really turns me off. It  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put way too much  <START:F_Ingredients>   garlic   powder <END>  combined with Mrs. Dash on it, ew.The texture is ok, but it's really not doing it for me. I prefer  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  Hut or Papa John's still if I'm going for a  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  on the quick.

If I ever leave Las Vegas Capriotti's will be the only thing I miss.  This is the only Capriotti's I went to that had an actual dine in  <START:Ambience> sit down area <END> .  All the other Capriotti's I've gone to had 2 or 3  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  for their  <START:Ambience> sit down area <END>  and that was it.  I think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END>  on all of their  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  so I always  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  w/no  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END>  since I'm not a fan of it.  My favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is the  <START:F_FoodItem> capastrami <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sla-be-joe <END>  was ok and the  <START:F_FoodItem> bobby <END>  is always a good choice.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have plenty of other  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  to choose from but I haven' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  tried any others because I always get the  <START:F_FoodItem> capastrami <END> .  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  are a little more than what you'd expect from a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but I feel like it's definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it and it's still very reasonable.  A small  <START:F_FoodItem> 9 inch sub <END>  is around $7, a  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  12 inch is $9 and a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  20 inch is $13.  Every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  you eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  give you a $3 off coupon for your next visit.  You have to go online and fill out a short questionnaire but it's  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it to get some money off for your next visit.  Other than the  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END>  overload the only thing I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  close at 8 but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are still deserving of 5 stars despite of that.

After nearly 4 years I've finally ventured out to Chaya.  What took me so long?  I'm always mildly hesitant about  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  when I'm in a city not by the coast, but a man does what he's gotta do when he's got a craving.Three of us  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  combination platter to split as well as our own  <START:Food> food <END> .  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> yellowtail cheeks <END> , my friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  eel, and my last friend is boring.First came the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  It was pretty standard, but any sign of  <START:F_Ingredients> vegetation <END>  is a good thing for the college male.Next up was their  <START:F_FoodItem> karaage <END> .  Ohmygoodness it was the best  <START:F_FoodItem> karaage <END>  I have ever had.  Now I've never had  <START:F_FoodItem> karaage <END>  in Japan, but lots of people hyped it up for me and I was scared it would be a letdown.  The flesh was so flavorful and juicy it completely blew my mind away and left me craving more as soon as it was over.  Drool. <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was also pretty standard.The  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  combination was a disappointment.  Yes, we had it coming for  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  a platter of  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , but it was only b/c the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  platters would have either been too  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  (the 70 dollar boats) or too small (the 10 piece combo's).  In retrospect we should have just  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a la carte Nigiri...  I noticed halfway through the  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had Anago available that night too...My  <START:F_FoodItem> yellowtail cheeks <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  Personally I love  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  cheeks (as well as the part of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  right by the tail when I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  whole).  It's super  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and rich and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  so delicate.My end of the bill came out to be around 30, which was perfectly.  I would've been perfectly happy if we had dropped the  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  combination and I had picked up a piece of Toro and a piece of Anago instead. <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent and the their timing was impeccable;  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have it all down to an  <START:A_Decor> art <END> .  The next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm back I completely want to try their Omakase.  In Japanese it means "It's up to you" with "you" being the  <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> I was slightly  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END>  when I saw my companions throw their wasabi into soy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and completely mix it up.  That is not how  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  should be eaten.....

Cabo is my favorite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . As a  <START:Ambience> huge <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  lover I am always in heaven when I visit. No matter what you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  everything is always  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  items aren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  overly complicated and the featured specials are always a hit. Two thumbs up!

 <START:W_Price> worth <END>  every damn  <START:W_Price> penny <END> .

Who wouldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ?? The weather is  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  so we  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  Jimmy Johns.  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  it at 1:39...he rings my bell at 1:50. Needless to say the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great. From  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  to receiving its an all around good  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .

very  <START:A_Decor> trendy <END>  mexican  <START:Restaurant> resturant <END>  that has horrible  <START:Service> service <END>  from old ladies who can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  hear or move fast enough to keep your  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  filled.  and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  smells very bad.  i suggest a little remodeling along with some spring cleaning.

Since my last review I have been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  many times and I must say  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  has improved a lot!  I really do love their  <START:Food> food <END> ... as of late I am stuck on their Artesian  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  Melt... YUM!  So  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  get another star:)

Went to grab a quick  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  yesterday with a colleague and we decided to go to Pita House.   <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  Mistake.We called in our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> gal <END>  on the phone seemed like it we were putting her out.  I guess the computer in the non  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  section (where we'd be picking up our  <START:Food> food <END> ) was down.  We weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  told how long it would be or how much our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  was going to cost.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem>   gyro   pita <END>  with the house  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . We head over,  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  and get out  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  (the  <START:S_Staff> gal <END>  seemed irritated to have to walk over to the other side to run the card), and head back to work.  I dive into my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and something is off.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END> , like wilted  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END> .  Who wants to eat  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  floppy  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> ?  Anyone...Anyone...Bueller?    My  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END>  was drowning in tzatziki.  I ended up throwing most of my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  away -   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no salvaging any of it.  Not sure if  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's new  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  or  <START:S_Staff> management <END> ...but the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and customer  <START:Service> service <END>  has definitely gone downhill.  If I return, it wont be for a while.

Ive been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  like 5 times now and the only thing I get is the Danny's special. That's the only reason I give it a 5 star lol Can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  speak for  <START:Food> anything <END>  else!Anyway, the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are AMAZING. I hate when  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are soggy on the outside,  but these are perrrfect,  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  on the outside but still smothered in  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I get the  <START:F_FoodItem> mild <END>  and my boyfriend usually gets the  <START:F_FoodItem> teriyaki <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are both delish. AND it comes with  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> !  10  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  & seasoned  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  for like 8 bucks, always hits the spot and fills me up

the outdoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  is great with the  <START:A_OutsideView> waterfall <END>  in the  <START:A_OutsideView> background <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was mediocre, while the  <START:Service> service <END>  was good and outdoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  great, i would  <START:O_Experience> not go back <END>  secondary to the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END> . to note:  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  serve until 2 am!

Never had a bad  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Good  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is always  <START:Ambience> crowded <END> . Great for people watching.

I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  twice and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END> ! The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went it was very packed for the USA World Cup  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> . I split the pretzel  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , which came with  <START:F_FoodItem> phenomenal   mustard   <END> . The pretzels were  <START:F_FI_Size> massive <END>  and really  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END> , soft, and great. I shared the Tap Room Tenderloin and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  it with Chipotle  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . It was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly and the chipotle really enhanced the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> . Would definitely recommend. Shared a pitcher of Sunbru which was really great and refreshing on a hot summer day. The second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went with  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  from New Jersey who are quite picky folks.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had just gotten in from a long flight and were starved.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were SUPER  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with the  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> , both of my parents  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  flights and loved all. As for  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> - we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , which to our  <START:A_Environment> pleasant <END>  surprise were way  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicier <END>  than expected, the  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> artichoke dip <END> , which was filled with way more  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  than I had ever had, the Thai Hummus, which was superb, and a  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bruchetta <END> . Every single  <START:Food> item <END>  that touched my Sunbru cleansed palette was amazing. Not one thing was bland,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all kicked with amazing  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  and combinations I could never replicate. Can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  wait to keep trying the great things on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> !

For the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  and the amount of  <START:Food> food <END>  you get, I think it's only ok.  I'm a small little girl with a  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  stomach. I went to earls afterwards and put down a  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , a  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , and half a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great tho.  It's just a little too quiet in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for me. I almost fell asleep.

DEL INFERNO, MI CORAZONThis DT caught my eye one night while we were driving back to our room. Had I been driving, we surely would have been rear-ended because I have a tendency to slam on my brakes when I see their happy signs.Note: I only  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  crunchy  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> . Whether I'm at Del  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  Bell, I do not stray from my simple  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> : between 3 and 8 crunchy  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> . I usually prefer them with  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and extra  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have to have 3 packets of hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  (I like to use one  <START:F_FoodItem> mild <END> , one  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> , and one hot) and a half-packet of  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> . So  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  we are in Vegas and I see DT, so of course (!) I made my husband park even though we'd been on our feet all day and were exhausted. We found a  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  spot several blocks away and walked through a detour for construction and around some dark corners until we were finally back on the strip and headed up to the  <START:Food> food <END>  court. A polite  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  gave me my  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  ($1.59 each) and the night was complete. Del  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  - please come to Walnut Creek, CA :)  xoxo

Stoped by with the  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  for my little sister's birthday,  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a cheeseburger and Mozzerella Sticks. The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  sticks were  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , also very  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . The have these amazing super  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  shoestring  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  with  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>  seasoning. First  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I've been to this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , usually frequent Town Square but is very comparable.  <START:Service> service <END>  is very  <START:Service> consistent <END>  between the two.  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END> , good  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , great  <START:Service> service <END> , and plenty of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> . A little bit  <START:W_Price> pricey <END>  depending what you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , but overall a nice dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .

Probably the best  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in town. Wood fired oven (used for  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , of course) also bakes their own  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , and wonderfully  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasts <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  for their vege,  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a nice short list of house  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> , or build your own to suit. Obscure  <START:S_Menu>   wine   list <END>  is fine, no harm trying a selection you haven' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  heard of before. Deserts are all homemade as well.

Best  <START:F_Drinks> shake <END>  I have ever had...the French Kiss  <START:F_Drinks> shake <END>  with Bailey's and Kahlua...and this is coming from someone who worked at Baskin Robbins through high school.  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  were  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END> . My boyfriend and I chose the angus build-a- <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly and we really liked the ciabatta  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> . The jalapeno  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  was  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END> . The  <START:Food> chipotle aioli <END>  was really  <START:F_FoodItem> mild <END>  and good for dipping the sweet  <START:F_FoodItem>   potato     fries   <END> .  We will definitely return!

 <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> Colicchio, the naming of a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  cannot be more apt. And forgive little ole me for claiming that you, sir, got the craft of  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , down to a science. In my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , while other  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  excel on  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  typically fall apart when it comes to a collective  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  with the inclusion of the sides. Our selections of  the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  risotto,  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  gratinand Brentwood sweet corn had our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  clamoring for more.Oh, how I wish to revisit the evening soon.

I have been to the Great Dane for dinning and for just drinking on several occasions. I love the  <START:A_Decor> layout <END>  of the  <START:Ambience> building <END>  and the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> . The Dane  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is great. I also enjoy the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END> . If you just want  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  I recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> soft pretzels <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> artichoke dip <END> ! Of course you can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  forget the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  sampler!

Maybe i am just a sucker for  <START:Food> buffet <END> , but i like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . It isnt the best i've had.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  dont have a  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  section, just some  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , and clams and  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  ( <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> ), which are good nuff for me, considering the  <START:W_Price> price <END> . It is $18.95 sat-thru  <START:Food> dinner <END> , which is more reasonable than other hotel  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  in vegas. Friday night is  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  night, but i've never been. my Fave items  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  are: Prime Rib (fill up on these),  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> cream <END>  sprinkled on top,  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> cream <END>  rotellini. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is decent ( <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  being the best) and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a "make your own  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> " Station, for the picky eaters, about 40 different  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  ( <START:F_Dessert> chocolate mousse cake <END>  is best). and the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> , while  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , has a little funk on the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . It's borderline Chinese BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> -ish.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  should stick to one. A cross between  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  Kansas city BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and hoisin based  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  isnt that great on the palate.Nothing much to complain about. Not too many people know about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , so it is never  <START:Ambience> crowded <END>  the 3 times I've gone (i go to vegas quite a bit my friends).  <START:Service> service <END>  is ok. And  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:Ambience> huge <END> , so you will be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  :)

I'm a little late on writing this since I was in Vegas over Super Bowl weekend, but it's still  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  writing about.This WOULD HAVE been the best  <START:Restaurant> steakhouse <END>  I've ever been to, but it sadly wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END> .  This evening, I wanted to  <START:Service> treat <END>  my gf out to a great  <START:Food> dinner <END>  before hitting up Zumanity.  As usual, we ran a few minutes late, but  <START:S_Del_Time> 10 minutes <END>  isn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>   <START:Food> anything <END>  to fuss over at 99.9% of  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .  However, it took them over THIRTY minutes to  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  us.  Umm...with a show we don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  want to be late for, that's some crumby  <START:S_Staff> management <END>  of  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> .For the most part, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was top notch and the  <START:S_Staff> sommelier <END>  was great.  For  <START:Food> dinner <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the chateaubriand, the foir gras torchon, an iceberg  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  sides, and a great Bordeaux  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> .The  <START:Food> food <END>  was, for the most part, SUPERB.  Even the sides were as decadent as the main entrée.  I just wish we had had more  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  in the chateaubriand was juicy,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , and everything one could hope for as far as red  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  goes.  The  <START:F_FoodItem>   foie gras   torchon <END>  was excellent, just a little rich for my palate.  I've had  <START:F_FoodItem> foie gras <END>  every way you could have it and honestly, I prefer pan seared.In the end, we had a rushed  <START:Food> dinner <END>  because of being  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  late, getting the check took forever because of some "system problem", and we ended up being late to Zumanity!  GRRRR!It ended up being okay though, because when we got  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , one of the "actors" gave us shit about being late, but after we explained what happened, he hooked us up with front row/couch  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END> !  Thanks, SW for the Cirque upgrade, I guess...

Spoiler alert: the bill is average $120 per person.With that being said, if you want to be a foodie...or at least  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> act <END>  the part...or just be  <START:Service> treated <END>  like you own the Bellagio for a night, come right on down.  It's located down the escalators and it will be one of the most decadent  <START:Food> meals <END>  of your life.I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  claim to know  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  or  <START:F_Drinks> liqueurs <END>  but I know  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  must be seriously good for the  <START:W_Price> price <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is great about suggesting pairings with your  <START:Food> meal <END> .  What I do claim to know is  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do deliver.You can pick from 2  <START:S_Menu> menus <END> : the Degustation  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  (5 course) or the Prix Fixe (4 course).  With only a $10 difference, I opted for the 5 course.  I will summarize because many have  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  the gloriousness that I have and have lived to write about it as well.Maine  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> :  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  as in  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , etc.  Cool, refined, and accentuates the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> .  Not overly drowned in superfluous additives like mayo.Pan-seared Scallop:  I have  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END> ... but this was  <START:A_Decor> picture <END> -perfect, cut-with a fork, sophisticatedly simple. <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> foie gras <END> : probably my least favorite but only by personal  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  Nice blacked  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>  with a tangy center.  Basically blackened  <START:F_FoodItem> foie gras <END> .Kobe Filet Mignon: yes ladies and gentlemen, I chose to add $160 to my  <START:Food> meal <END>  and try this heavenly cut of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> .  Perfectly marbled and juicy (recommended  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> -rare).  While I may not agree that it should cost an additional $160, I cannot deny that it was the highlight of my  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and probably the best cut of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  I have ever  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> .  Also accompanied by a the best ring of mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  but still no contest.  You can get kobe cuts across the street at Gordon Ramsay  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  in Paris and frankly better than  <START:Food> anything <END>  I've eaten in my life (until I ate at Picasso). <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> :  by now you will be full and probably not appreciate the choice as much as you should.  Tough choices... but if you make it this far, congratulations and  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's to hoping payday comes soon after this  <START:Food> meal <END> .Great  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ... <START:S_Staff> they <END>  know that for a lot of us, this  <START:Food> meal <END>  hurts the pockets, but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> guide <END>  you through it and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  talk like all those fancy  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  in the movies too

Not the best  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was giving outstanding  <START:Service> service <END> .

Why on EARTH would  <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> Aaron Sanchez put his name on any of the  <START:Food> food <END>  at this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ?! Horrible! Tasteless! Don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  waste your  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  on  <START:Food> dinner <END> . Perhaps as a  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  venue it is OK, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was disgusting. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> . Sure the crunch was spot on but it was under  <START:F_Ingredients> salted <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> spiced <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  itself  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like worn out shoe leather. I followed this by one of  <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> Sanchez's signature  <START:Food> dishes <END>  - a half rack of  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> . One  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  into it and I was sorely  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  must have been steamed or  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> boiled <END> . It too was  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorless <END> . To cover this up, it was slathered with a  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END>  with hints of cayenne. This is not at all what I expected from an Adobo  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . It was just straight up YUCK! I had it all packaged up to take back to my hotel and was SO angry I tossed it in the garbage as I walked back to my room. Shame on you Aaron Sanchez. Either take your good name off such horse-menure  <START:Food> food <END>  or fire your executive  <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> and get someone who knows how to make it the way you intended it.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is adorable, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  give great  <START:Service> service <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . What's not to love!?

3.5 starsOur  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was incredibly nice and the Calamari  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Linguini al Mare and the description made it sound like  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  with marinara  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END> . It was actually like a  <START:F_FoodItem> cioppino <END> , which is not my favorite thing and having the linguini sitting in  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  great. If you like  <START:F_FoodItem> cioppino <END>  though,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are very generous with the  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END> .My bf got the  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  Orzo and he said it was way too  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END> . Still pretty good, but it needed more  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  or something to balance out the  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END> We were kind of  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END> , which is sad because we LOVE this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , especially the one in LA.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is amazing! I had the best BBQ ever....the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  were do  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> melted <END>  in my mouth and the Mac n  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was so good too! Highly recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and Donny,  <START:S_Staff> the manager <END> ,  really  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> cared <END>  that we were happy.

As visitors to Phoenix this past weekend, our group decided we wanted some  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> cuisine <END> . We found a review for this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  online and drove about 20 minutes (to what seemed like BFE) and finally arrived with hungry bellies. We were  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  by all 5 of the ladies standing near the entrance who  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  us quickly. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  arrived at our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  quickly for our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  and was quite helpful. My only complaint about the  <START:Service> service <END>  is that my friend's father wanted to try their $4 Rita-tini (?) that was advertised on the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  that was made with 3 Amigos Tequila. When he asked for the $4 special, we were told it was strictly for  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> . The sign itself said absolutely nothing about  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>  - and the only reason I mention this is because every other sign in the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  that offered a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  special -only for  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> - designated that clearly on the sign. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  amused when he jokingly asked if  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  could make an exception. Our  <START:Food> meals <END>  were simply  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . The carne asada was easily the best carne asada I've ever had, and being from Southern California I would like to think we have quite the selection. I personally  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a 2  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  plate, which included  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  differently from any other  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I have ever been to, it was incredibly juicy and surprisingly flavorful. I couldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  pin point exactly what the other people at my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  had  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> , but we were all settling into  <START:Food> food <END>  comas shortly after commencing our delightful  <START:Food> lunch <END>  (which wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  the best thing considering we all had a 5 hour drive to make back to California).If I ever find myself in Phoenix again, or even somewhere remotely close by- I would definitely stop in for another  <START:Food> meal <END> .

We went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at 5 pm for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with my adult kids to celebrate my wife's birthday.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great. Everyone seemed  <START:S_Stf_Appearance> professional <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .My kids love the Chilean Sea bass that was suggested by the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> , we even  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the second one.My wife was happy getting an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  from my kids a Giant Fortune Cookie with a "Happy Birthday" written on the plate.We went home with a good memory and would like to come back when we are in Vegas next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .

We found this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  via Opentable.com for our 10th wedding anniversary. The  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  isn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  bad. The Palms Hotel is not on the strip. You would have to take a cab to get  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . The average fare for a single trip: $10My husband  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  spaghetti. I forgot the name of  <START:Food> dish <END> . Out of world! Good  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> bone-in ribeye <END> . My gosh, the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was so juicy and I decided to keep some for home so I could enjoy chewing the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  a trip!

This  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is definitely just ok.  For $200 plus for three people I expect more.   <START:Food> food <END>  ok, nothing special.  You can get better at Wendy's Asian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  on Spring Mountain and Jones!  And definitely better  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  at Raku.  Japanaise is a lovely looking  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with very cool  <START:Ambience> ceilings <END>  but it ends  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  I didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like having a paper overlay on my tablecloth or the fact that the busboy took my fork off my used  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  plate and placed it back on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  for me to use on entrée.  Also, one of the three  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  arrived ten minutes after the other two were  <START:Service> served <END> .  Wanted to be polite, so I waited, and then my  <START:Food> dish <END>  was cold when I got to eat it.  What is the delay in getting a Hamachi  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  to the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ?  I truly throught  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  forgot my daughter's  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  it took so long.  I also said it was a birthday  <START:Food> dinner <END>  when I made  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and was told  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  acknowledge it.  Also whispered it to  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END> .  Nothing!  I am local and think I expect more  <START:Service> service <END> .  I won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  be coming back for sure.

Goodness gracious alive, do I ever love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .I head out to U.S.  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  a couple of Sundays a month with my roomie and her pops.  We are  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>   <START:W_Waiting> speedily <END> , and any number of leggy beauties are at our beck and call for the entirety of our stay.  The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  is gracious, and the  <START:S_Staff> waitresses <END>  are perpetually smiling.  The vibe is  <START:A_Decor> light <END> .The clientele runs from old folks to hipsters to the hangover crowd.  The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has quite a bit to choose from, but I always have the  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  florentine (try it; i promise you won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  regret it).   I've heard tell that the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  benedict and  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  over easy are remarkable, as well.   <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  leave a pitcher of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cold  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  with us as we eat-- <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  pester us or rush us or hint that we need to leave, even when our conversations run long.  I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  think of a better  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get  <START:Food> breakfast <END> .

The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is good. I looove the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> . It is young and fun. Yes,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is amigos... but a wise man would know that  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is not about that, but the dedication and love of the  <START:Food> food <END> . I eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  once a week. I do have to agree though that the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  or  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  are not included. But its good and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:Service> treat <END>  you well.

I used to go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a lot for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  when I worked in Old Town, if the line wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  super long. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END> , all the while keeping it really  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . Everything I have tried has not  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END>  and the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is so good. Turkey club was my usual  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .

Sardella's does a pretty decent  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and with the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  it's convenient to stop in an pick one up on the way home. That's about as good as it gets. It's like  <START:F_FoodItem> rolling <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Size> dice <END>  when you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . You ask for blue  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  with your  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  you get ranch. You  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  without an  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  you are allergic to, you might get the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  anyway. And honestly, how hard is it to cut a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  think I've ever been to a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that has cut a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in a way that  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were little triangle pieces in the middle. Not just once, but 3 times. Today was the last straw, I truly saw what was behind this locations issues. I spoke to a  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  behind the counter that appeared to be running the store about my last  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  that was supposed to be half works, but ended up less than a third covered with  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> . His feed back was "yeah?', 'Have you ever tried to make a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ?'. Are you kidding me? I told him I was only trying to bring it to his attention and he continued on with 'Listen, I have to feed 100 people/hour'. That's a great attitude and clearly shows that  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  Assurance is NOT Sardella's primary objective. Take it for what it is, I've been coming to this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  on just about a weekly basis but I can confidently say that I can only put up with so much.

LOVE THIS  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !  i could eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  all the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  i always go for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with friends or for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> .  great for kids.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is grass for the kids to run around on.  it is like going on a picnic at the park but with great  <START:Food> food <END> .  we go about once a month! well maybe more!

 <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ..  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was helpful. Just made a quick stop before a concert with my lady. I will definantley try to go back next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  i'm in the area..!!

I had the worst  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  skin  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> ) in my life  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ! It was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burnt <END> .... other  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  are medocre at best. Mido and kabuki are way better than this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .

Pho-gettaboudit... not  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> , the spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were over- <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  in the pho was no bueno.  The others at my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  seemed to enjoy their  <START:Food> meal <END> , but I think  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're just used to being let down.Also, let me stand on my soap box and announce something to all small business  <START:S_Staff> owners <END> .  You don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like it when people  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  with credit or debit cards?  You don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  that 3-4.5% fee for electronic  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  customers?  Huh.  Well guess what... you should build that into your  <START:W_Price> pricing <END> !  'Cause guess what?  NO ONE likes to see a sign that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  will be  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  50 cents or whatever extra just because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have cash.  It rubs me the wrong way almost every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  - and I know I'm not the only one.  So - in the best interest of your getting people to RETURN and RECOMMEND your  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  of business to others?  Get with the 21st century and suck it up - debit / credit cards aren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  going anywhere.

My parents owned a Korean  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  so I know good Korean  <START:Food> food <END> ! I enjoyed their Kalbi (short  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> ) kalbi tang (short rib  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ) bulgogi ( <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  marinated  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ) tofu  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> mackerel combo <END>  and their  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  has been times where the side  <START:Food> dishes <END>  weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  as good. For instance the  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>  kimchi was soggy and  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts were bland but the main  <START:Food> dishes <END>  made up for it.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do get busy so the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  button that's on every  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  comes in handy when you need something.

The iceberg  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with what was kindly called " <START:F_FoodItem> buttermilk ranch <END> ", actually just "buttermilk" i'm pretty sure....was sub-optimal.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  were good, and the special I got the night I went was freaking amazing.  Overall, it was a semi-quiet  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to sit and have a  <START:Food> meal <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were very polite and excellent, I was never wanting for a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , and everything ran very smoothly.

Chocolate  <START:F_FoodItem> cupcake <END>  - real good.

Sweet, sweet gluttonous Maizie's. I always emerge from the dimly  <START:A_Decor> lit <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  riddled with guilt at my lack of self control, but I keep coming back for more!  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  is hectic and the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  remains consistently busy, but neither are such an issue that I would feel hesitant to come  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .The inside has urban swank and remains unpretentious. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> personable <END>  but not  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> overbearing <END> . And the  <START:Food> food <END> ...oh God, the  <START:Food> food <END> ! The buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  dip is cheesy, high calorie, ooey gooey  <START:F_FI_Taste> deliciousness <END> .  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  chunks of partially  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> melted <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  swim in the dip, making it incredibly filling. The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  pesto  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is way too good as well...thick cuts of  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , dripping  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , generously spread pesto and perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END> .The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is amazing! What a unique idea. I love the quirky, well balanced  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is something to fit most moods and cravings. I need to come in for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and brunch to see what the day  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  is like, but I'm sure I won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  be  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END> .

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is in the popular section of Old Montreal.  We had our first Monsieur Croquette - who knew a  <START:F_FoodItem> ham <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  could be so  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  We also had the  <START:F_FoodItem>   smoked     salmon   <END>  which was  <START:O_Experience> very satisfying <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was good and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> .  The best part is the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  and the  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  from the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  for people watching.

We love this  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> !  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have the best  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  in town and great  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END>  and selection. Try the Las Vegas  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> -- so good!

Absolutely amazing!!! We were 3 guys. I went with 2 other guys and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are both real foodies. We all said that it might have been top 3  <START:Food> meal <END>  of all  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . No one had  <START:Food> anything <END>  slightly bad to say. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  like champions. We shared 4  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , 2  <START:F_FoodItem> mains <END> , and 2  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> . The Duck  <START:F_FoodItem> carpaccio <END>  was IMPECCABLE! Duck in a can was an  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and it was well  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it. It is really a  <START:Service> treat <END>  to dine at a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  like PDC.

Very impressive.We sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  overlooking the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>  prepare every  <START:Food> dish <END> .  It was a great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  being in the thick of it and seeing them work so cohesively - when it came to our  <START:Food> food <END>  we appreciated it even more!The  <START:F_FoodItem> foie gras <END>  poutine was excellent.  My only complaint would have been to have had more  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> , but I guess this isn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  necessarily a bad thing! We had considered getting a  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  (given the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  name involves a pig) but decided to go for Duck in a can.  Its unique and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .Would recommend going  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  if you are in Montreal, but make a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END> !

Farmer Boys is OK for a change. Nothing spectacular  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , just good  <START:Food> food <END> , good  <START:W_Price> price <END> .I do find that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  slop too much  <START:F_Ingredients> mustard <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .  Not one of the top  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  places in Vegas.

I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  know why I was so reluctant to dine at the Nordstrom Cafe at first;  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  after  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END>  proves to be  <START:F_FI_Quality> superior <END>  to other local offerings, regardless of the particular Nordstrom  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> . In this case, we were at the Fashion Show  <START:F_FI_Size> mall <END> , and I opted for the cranberry  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on the advice of the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> . My wife got the blackened  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  on a Caesar  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Both were excellent, and the  <START:Service> service <END>  as always was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> .The only thing I would point out is that the room temperature always seems to lean a bit towards the polar  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  caps side of the thermometer. For me, this is a plus, but be warned if you are one of those people who likes a  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  room.

 <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's not much else to say that hasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  already been said. Behold, the £2.00 sub!Serving up a lovely variety of scrummy fillings, All Good lives up to its good name by delivering excellent  <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , soft filled  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and the £2 sub deal that has successfully bowled me over.Even during  <START:Food> lunch <END>  hour you will  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  speedy  <START:Service> service <END>  from  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , and plenty to choose from off their up-to-date  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Their website is pretty straightforward to navigate - fun and modern while also giving you some insight into the lunchtime  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Great if you're nipping in on your  <START:Food> lunch <END>  hour or have a busy day of shopping ahead of you, All Good is really good at spoiling us!

Everything is bad but the $2 Miller lites

Black Dog has THE best BBQ in the Champaign/Urbana area hands down.  Now all  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  need is a larger  <START:A_Places> space <END>  to serve it in, i love the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  setting, but not one that has outgrown its  <START:A_Places> space <END>  because of how good their product is.  Waits are common of up to 30 mins anytime you go.As for the  <START:Food> food <END> , lets start with the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> smoked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and the kick of the Carolina BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  puts them over the top.  My wife can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  stop talking about how good the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burnt <END>  ends are, and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  must not be the only one because the sell out frequently.   Loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> , just wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had some baby backs to choose from.All in all you will not beat this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for BBQ anywhere within a hundred miles!

 <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and a good value. Don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  let the name fool you, not everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is greasy. Wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a little more indoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  so one could avoid the flies and the heat, but I guess that is part of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> 's character.

 <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>  pho  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  I usually get the #7 ( <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chickens <END> .)  Although the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  Pho is pretty good too.  Honestly, I have not been  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END>  an  <START:Food> anything <END>  I've had from  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  The Thai  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> iced <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  is really good, too.  When you first walk in to the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , you may think twice - it is an old  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  bell converted to vietnamese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  But don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  let that stop you - the  <START:Food> food <END>  is excellent.  I've gotten a lot of people hooked on the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  - even people who are picky eaters and won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  try  <START:Food> anything <END>  "non-american."

My wife brought me  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  on a Sunday.  The Pastrami was  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END> .  I believe this is one a a few different locations for Archies.  I'll be back......and I'll probably have the Pastrami again (that's how I  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> ).

 <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  flies when you're having fun...It's been almost a full year since my initial review of  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> , and I've been back probably ten times or more.I've seen a lot of transition with the  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  but I can say that their  <START:Service> service <END>  has gotten much better since the beginning.  The casual  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is right up my alley for a weekend  <START:Food> breakfast <END> , and my yogi  <START:F_FoodItem> omelette <END>  / protein  <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  have stayed  <START:Service> consistent <END>  too.  I was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  earlier today and while the  <START:Service> service <END>  was spot-on, I did find a piece of  <START:F_FoodItem> ham <END>  in my otherwise  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelette <END>  - but I overlooked it and enjoyed my  <START:Food> meal <END>  nonetheless...My husband has been to  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  even more than i have, and he told me he recently sampled what's to come on their new  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  (think pastrami  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ).  So, go for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> , go for  <START:Food> lunch <END> , go for a Bloody Mary or a  <START:F_Drinks> mimosa <END> ... just kick back and enjoy your  <START:Food> meal <END> !

I love their  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ! Even though  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  serve cold Dolma it is still pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I also like their  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  with some artichokes. The  <START:W_Price> price <END>  is about $6.00 a pound but it is very filling and  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END> . This is a perfect  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat for someone who is broke but would still like to have a nutritious  <START:Food> meal <END> .

This area is severely lacking in sit down  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  choices, so this was nice to see a sit down  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  going into the old Nicks 24/7, especially because it seems to have taken them 1200 years to get this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  open...I had actually thought  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had pulled out it took so long.The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  are yum.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END>  are nice.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have this italian  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  which is absolutely divine!  I just wish the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  had more side choices.  You get a bland  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  at  <START:Food> lunch <END>  or  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> zucchini <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  at  <START:Food> dinner <END>  which are nice when  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , but if left too long before hitting the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are cold and floppy.  I have found the  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  to be hit and miss.  Their tiramisu is totally delish!  And anyone that knows me knows, that if the tiramisu doesn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  impress I am hard pressed to come back.The  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  sways between  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  or absent, guess its just the luck of the draw.  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are right, and if you sign up for their monthly newsletter you get some pretty nice bargains.

After arriving in Vegas off of an early morning flight, we wanted to find a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to grab some quick  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and where we could enjoy the beautifully hot and sunny weather.  We headed out from our hotel, Aria, and Cabo Wabo's  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  fit the bill.  The second floor  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  provided nice  <START:A_OutsideView> views <END>  of the Bellagio  <START:A_OutsideView> lake, <END> and the misters under the umbrellas were an added bonus!We started with some  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and queso which came with two  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  baskets of corn  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  was ok, the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was really runny, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  were in  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  pieces which make dipping a challenge.For  <START:F_FoodItem> mains <END> , between us we had the Baja  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> , the jalapeno  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , and the southwest cobb  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was a bit  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> overcooked <END>  and dry, but the overall  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavour <END>  was good and  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  featured  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> grilled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  which was also a bit try, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  definitely weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  the best I'd ever had.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  looked great, and was a  <START:Ambience> huge <END>   <START:A_Places> portion <END> . <START:Restaurant> there <END>  definitely wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  any  <START:Food> food <END>  that would be  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  returning for.  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were a bit  <START:W_Price> expensive <END>  for what we got, particularly the $15  <START:F_Dessert> banana <END>  mama  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  that was not that  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> , but was well versed in upselling, however not in a pushy way.I wouldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  return,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Vegas with equally decent  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patios <END>  that I would try first.

Really good  <START:F_FI_Size> spice <END>  level.   <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  plates.  Pretty mundane po'boys.  Overly charred  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  Incredible  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END> .Cramped indoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  but still good eats.  Don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  if you're vegetarian.

 <START:Food> meals <END>  were excellent!  Softshell po boy,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END> , all wonderful! <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were good - the  <START:F_FoodItem> bananas foster <END>  were great!Friday night  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  - it was loud but very  <START:A_Environment> pleasant <END> .

I'm very picky when it comes to  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , but one thing I will say it's their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  delivery to my hotel room and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were right on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . I had their  original  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were cut in squares no biggie, the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  greasy their a little more  <START:W_Price> expensive <END>  than  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  hut but it was all  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it. You get what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for.

Met a friend  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and we were both well  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was good and fast, so fast  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also cleared my chai before I was done drinking it! <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  and well seasoned. Though you'd expect nothing less from this Italian 'chain'. I've been to La Favourita a few times, but this was my first visit to Vittoria and I wouldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  hesitate to return.  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are reasonable for center of town and  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  too bad, tho it was definitely a 2 course  <START:Food> lunch <END> . Think I would have left slightly hungry if I hadn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  had  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .

Okay so I have been to the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  in Hawaii and was happy to know that on my visits  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in Vegas I can now satisfy my tastebuds again with more of "Thelmas Special"(crunchy luau style  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  in thelmas  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ). This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has something for everyone. It combines a great value on their  <START:Food> entrees <END>  and even better is  <START:Service> served <END>  up by some of the  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendliest <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  who really make you feel  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END> ! Give em' a try!!!

Went to the Auld Hoose with a group of Yelpers in search of  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> .  Well, it wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  much of a search, we had previously been informed that this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has the biggest  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  ever - seriously see the  <START:A_Decor> pictures <END> !!  So I came armed with a hunger to match.  3 of us shared a bowl of these Mega  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  that are suggested for 3-4.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  came pretty quickly and looked amazing when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did.  Great ratio of  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  to  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> , as so often  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is just not enough.  Chilli  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END> , sour  <START:F_Ingredients> cream <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  throughout.  It took us a good 20 minutes or so to make a serious dent in the mound and start to get to the underneath layers, which were still hot.  After eating about a quarter of the bowl myself, I really should have stopped, but as I hate wasting  <START:Food> food <END>  and the other 2 had had enough, I just kept shovelling it in....literally.....using the  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  to shovel up the  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> .   <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  mistake.  When I finally finished all the  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> , apart from some jalapeños which are a little on the  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  side for my  <START:F_FoodItem> mild <END>  palate,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a only a handful of  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  left.  About 15 minutes later, when I got up to use the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END> , I realised just how full I was - serious  <START:F_FoodItem> muffin <END>  top and struggled to do my pants back up.  Walking home was not at all comfortable, more of a waddle.  Then I seriously needed to lie down and stretch out.  I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  hesitate to say that these are the best  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  I've ever had.  I just wish we had a 4th person to help us eat the monstrosity.As for the pub; it is quite small, but with character.  Laid back  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , heavy  <START:A_Ent_Music> rock <END>  playing in the  <START:A_OutsideView> background <END> , not your usual pub  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> .  Would definitely go back for the  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  alone, but I might give it a while!

Great selection.  Lamb vindaloo is excellent.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. I used to visit the Paradise  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  until it closed due to salmonella. I figured this Westside  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  would be fine. My coworker and I went last night for  <START:Food> dinner <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was absolutely terrible considering  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were about a quarter full, but we dealt with it.Soon after we got home we were both experiencing terrible abdominal pains, followed by throwing up every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  we ate. This went on for a few hours. Double  <START:Food> food <END>  poisoning? Disgusting. <START:S_Staff> they <END>  need to revamp their entire business. Kitchen,  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END> . Firefly is headed down a bad road.

This is my favorite  <START:Food> buffet <END>  in vegas. I used to frequent the rio and m  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  for years, but ever since i tried this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , i'm never going back. Some of the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Service> served <END>  individually in small pots or  <START:Food> dishes <END>  which is nice since i have no  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  control. ALL of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  i tried that had starchy  <START:F_FoodItem> carbs <END>  were good. (i.e. the leek  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END> !!!! this was ridiculous and the risotto) ONLY gripe was that the prime rib was over- <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  by my standards. The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was murder.... I think i ate like 40 chocolate covered  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END> . I swear  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sprinkled a little bit of crack into each one.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had oreo-covered marshmallows,  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>   <START:F_Dessert> shortcake <END> , and a bunch of little things of which i had no idea their names or what  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  consisted of. But most of it was pretty darn good. I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  wait to go back in a couple weeks and GO TO TOWN on their  <START:Food> buffet <END> .

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was recommended by a friend when I moved to Las Vegas.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Service> consistent <END> , and everyone I have brought  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  LOVES it!

 <START:F_Drinks> yummy <END>  locally  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> . loved the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> iced <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  growler over the summer. just the basics, but  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .

very  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END> -went in just minutes before closing  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ... was just getting a "quick" sub &  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  to go.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was 1 other customer in shop. i parked in handicap  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  spot right in front. made my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  filled my  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . had a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  to wait for my sub (*because of my handicap) "shift mgr. graham" had stepped out to give that other customer something that was accidentally left out of his  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  as graham came back in he says "just so you know,  we're closed" then gave me an awkward look... then walked away... & i know he knew that i was dumbfounded by his comment because he kept awkwardly looking over at me - i hadn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  even received my  <START:Food> food <END> - how did he know if i was or wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  planning to eat in shop or leave.  or was that just his way of saying get out...???  well when i did receive my  <START:Food> food <END>  i had asked for his name so i could call back the next day to speak to  <START:S_Staff> management <END> .  graham had the  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  that who gave me his name, & he wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  aware that is good friend text my son to "apologize if he sounded disrespectful" not even 5 minutes after i left the shop... seems to me that graham was rethinking the way he was speaking to customers... ya think???

Fabulous  <START:Food> food <END> !!!!!  Great  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> !!!  Fabulous customer  <START:Service> service <END> !!!!  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was great will go again!!!  Have already told at least 10 other people to go try it out!!!  Fun little spot!!!!  Make sure to make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  as  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  get very busy!!!  The people working  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  where so helpful & kind & all had a beautiful smile!!!  Can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  wait to go again!!!

Superb  <START:Service> service <END> , excellent Deer  <START:F_FoodItem> carpaccio <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and rich  <START:F_FoodItem> lamb shank <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly. Very satisfied  <START:Food> diner <END> .

I was going to be generous and give three stars but then I tried the peach cobbler. When I walked up to the podium to  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  I asked if I could sample their BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The man said he would bring out the house BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and some type of sweet BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I did not like either  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and this should have been an inclination of what was to come. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the two  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  plate with pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and for my side I chose the baked  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  <START:S_Del_Time> 10 minutes <END>  later my  <START:Food> food <END>  was ready. First, I tried the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and both were less then impressive. I used some BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that I had at home to spruce up the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . Next, I tried the baked  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  were good, I liked the chunks of  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  and I think their house BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  better when it is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  into something. Lastly, the peach cobbler was inedible. I took one  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  and that was it, all I could  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  was nutmeg. Still in search of good BBQ in Las Vegas and that includes the sides as well.

Super  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  Tuesdays and Thursdays. I had always preferred traditional  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  (Tuesday) over boneless  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  (Thursday). Personally the boneless  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  somehow do not feel like I'm having  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> . Despite being easier to eat, I would like my  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  to be messy, but that is just me =)I have tried a  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  variety from the non  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  Sweet BBQ  to the extremely  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  Wild. Some favorites are Parmesan and  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> , Honey BBQ, Asian Zing and Mango Habanero.The  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  Tuesdays is the only reason for showing up. It's a great way to get  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .

I've been wanting to try this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but since the other ramen  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had overly  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END>  broth the last two times, I got turned off eating ramen all together.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a odd day of constant rain and cool temps in this blister which needed to be celebrated with some  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . Made for a perfect excuse to have something warming.I grabbed up a  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  ramen and the BF went for  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  ramen and on the recommendation of the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  for a "lighter" broth got shoyu base. The  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> savory <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END>  (has some oil floaties, but enough to be a deterrent) and not overtly  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END> . I really like that it comes with a soft  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> boiled <END>  soy  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> , the thicker rustic  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roast <END>  style cut of chashu was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and the ramen was rightfully chewy. This is a bit different from the traditional Sapporo  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  I'm used to as it normally has corn,  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts,  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> . I suppose I could add those  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . I took a  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of the BFs shoyu  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  broth and it was fairly good. Still a bit porky, but much lighter since it isn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  creamy like the  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  crept up to a  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burn <END> . We got a mini chashu bowl to share. It was much smokier than the chashu in the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  so it seems  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  throw it on the grill before serving and top with a drizzle of sweet soy so it's a different  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . I like this preparation. I wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer some  <START:F_Ingredients> vinegar <END>  as a side condiment as the little bit of acid would be nice with the sweet. We came within the last hour of being open so I figured that's why  <START:Service> service <END>  is quick, but hope that it  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  comes out that fast regularly. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  make us feel rushed. I definitely prefer this over the other ramen  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Somehow my BF got it in his head he doesn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like ramen so even though I like it, it may be a trek I make again alone.

I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  say enough good things about Postino. As far as locations go, I think Gilbert has the best  <START:Food> food <END>  overall followed by Postino Arcadia and then Postino Central, but I would give all of them 5 stars except Postino Central which I gave 4 (due to freshness of  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> ). If this is your first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  trying Postino, you MUST try the  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> . It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are trying to copy Postino's  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> , but it is never as good. Aside from the  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic. Most importantly, the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> really nice <END>  also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have their special - any bottle of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  AND a tray of  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> ! It cannot be beat!!

Hands down, the best sisig we've  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  in the US.  <START:Service> service <END>  sucked though. Took a really long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  for us to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  (although  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were a few empty  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> ),  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  took an even longer  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to come back to get our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and we were already halfway done with our  <START:Food> meal <END>  when the sisig came out. The  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  beside us who came in later than us got their sisig way ahead of us so maybe  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  forgot our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . Good thing the sisig was  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the wait! Will definitely go back for that.

I'll keep it simple. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  sits right under Five Guys and In-N-Out on my list of favorite fast ( <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> )  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  joints... It's a great  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , very  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> ... but you don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have as many options and the  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  even compare to Five Guys. I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  and swiss char... that's basically the extent of their  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  options... and I thoroughly enjoyed it! But the whole  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I was thinking I wish this  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  had  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  jalapenos on it!!Nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but given the choice I'm going across the street...

Normally I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  give 2 star's but I am going to give this over hyped  <START:Food> buffet <END>  one for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  being that I'm a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  lover and have  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  in tons of them to compare to.First off this is as I seen one if not the most  <START:W_Price> expensive <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END> 's in town right now with myself  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  $48 to get in even with a player's card.2nd off I have no clue how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  got 500  <START:Food> dishes <END>  out of the mixture  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no way by far 500  <START:Food> dishes <END>  in this  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is the same amount of selection from stateion to station as any other typical  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  in Vegas maybe  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  trying to hype up the fact you can CUSTOMIZE a  <START:Food> dish <END>  up to 500 ways but either way I'm not buying it because I was expecting to see once again THE KING OF  <START:Food> buffet <END> 'S  <START:Restaurant> here <END> !Let's say the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  was very poor, the  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  in some  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  in a bag, the Italian  <START:Food> food <END>  was very bland nothing interesting or unique especially the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  balls  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frozen <END>  freezer selection.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  even serve  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  so I had to settle on  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  chops also that were very  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>  in  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .. just the list goes on and on of just miss after miss of trying to hit the spot on  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and selection.The only positive thing I can say about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is that my greeter was very nice and gave me a quick tour of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was a very nice gentleman which I tipped him accordingly but other then that I'll never return.

Hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is very good.

 <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  my husband and I love it.  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is really  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great.

Absolutely love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !!! So pleased that it arrived in the Surprise area! This  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  has great  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  and if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  ever do make a mistake (which has happened only once in the 100+ times I've been  <START:Restaurant> there <END> )  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are very quick to make sure that you are  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and properly taken care of! Love me some Freddy's!

Had early Friday night pre-theater  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Once we got a  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> 's attention the  <START:Service> service <END>  was very good.  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  with good suggestions but not intrusive. Casual open  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>   <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> , causal but lively ambience, perfect for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with friends. My wife & her friend enjoyed a "prickly pear  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END> " not too sweet very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> !  Excellent  <START:Food> food <END>  overall  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> . Guac was  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  & paired well with the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> . We had 3  <START:Food> dishes <END>  perfect for sharing. Mexican street corn nicely  <START:F_Ingredients> spiced <END>  a bit messy but  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it. Nice  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  updated take on classic fare. Will certainly go back!

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in town and Chu is hella cutie . Ron is great and all the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END>  are  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  . I try to come all the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> 

We were excited to have a  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  joint in the area - but unfortunately we will not be  <START:F_FI_Size> regulars <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is extremely  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  - opening the door as we walked in and a  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  taking our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  immediately - but the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  cannot make up for the sub par  <START:Food> food <END> .  We had  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  that was over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  - followed by my husbands  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  that to me looked canned - and he said did not  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  much better - not to mention the double corn tortillas could not even stay together.  Move on to my  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> grilled <END>  mahi  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  that somehow was extreme greasy. I also had a side of plantains that were more like  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burnt <END>  sautéed bananas than plantains - though my husbands  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were good.  So we may be back for a  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  - but not  <START:Food> food <END> .Oh and one last note - the  <START:A_Decor> decorations <END>  are very beachish - but the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was not - it should have been old beach  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  - Beach Boys, Steel Drums, Bob Marley etc...

This is a review from a  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  lover. Went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for a bday party and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  does not serve  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  /  <START:F_Drinks> liquor <END> , only a few  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> . Just writing this as an FYI to anyone expecting a variety of  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  choices. Not a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  person....? Go somewhere else.

Oh man, first of all I am soooo happy  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is finally a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  like this in the east valley. Second, it's amazing! The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is super cute and  <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and helpful, and the  <START:Food> food <END> ... Holy  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END> , yum! So far, the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  duo and the  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  are both incredible. I'll definitely be back to try more since pretty much everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  sounds  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . Oh and if you like peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  & jelly  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have an  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cupcake <END> !

 <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> grilled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  is where it's at! love these  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> . I've tried them all

3.5 stars for  <START:Food> food <END> . I really enjoyed the shawarma. It was very flavorful.  The dolmades was good too. It has the right acidity on it. The  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END> , however, was dry and lacking  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  feta  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  lacks  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and it  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like an old refried  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> . If it's not then it was way over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> .  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 3 stars <END>  for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> : we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $26.10 for 2 combo  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  wrap with one side each. FYI their combo doesn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  come with  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . You would assume for the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  it does.

I'm so rarely on the early end of a  <START:A_Decor> trendy <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  that I feel pretty cool having visited The Summit Room just a month after  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  opened! It looks totally different than when it was Bruegger's - I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  speak to the Mayobird side, but I definitely felt like I was in a casual,  <START:A_Decor> trendy <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . A girlfriend and I went after work and got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  right at 5:00 when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  opened. We were only the second people in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , and we grabbed a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  itself is awfully pretty... glass bottles as far as the eye can see and silver  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Furniture> stools <END>  lend themselves to a very clean, modern feel without being sterile.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were maybe 12-14  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , a few  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  along the side, and a high, long  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  at the front near the front door.  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's also a  <START:Ambience> huge <END> , inviting  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> , but it was a little sweltering the night we were  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . I also love the  <START:Ambience> huge <END> , private  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot, which is a little rare on East Blvd.Our  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> , Scott, was so fun and gave us honest recommendations on what to get. I think he got a little overwhelmed later in the evening, but I'm guessing  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're just getting their footing. We opted to split the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  flat  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  flat  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  came in four pieces, which were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  if just a smidgen dry, and the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , too. It came over a corn  <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END> , which  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  verrrry corny, so buyer beware. We were also given complimentary cheddar scones before  <START:Food> dinner <END> , which  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like the  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  Red  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  cheddar bay biscuits, only in  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  scone form... mmmmm.We each got a signature  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END> ;  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are 7, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're named after the tallest summit on each continent. The Mount Vinson was very smooth - cinnamon, ginger  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , vanilla - and The Kilimanjaro was refreshing and sweet for summer -  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END> , cranberry, gin.When we left, we noticed that the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  was packed! This is a great " <START:A_Environment> classy <END> " addition to a casual row of  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  on East Blvd. Do yourself a favor, and check out The Summit Room.

Nice new chain all u can eat  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Tokyo, <START:Service> service <END>  are fast and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> , <START:Food> food <END>  are almost  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> ,especially the raw  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  which was sweet and  <START:F_Drinks> yummy <END> !One downside is the mussel  <START:Food> dishes <END>  we had last night were not so  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> .The  <START:A_Decor> decoration <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is cool, I like the fancy chandelier ,maybe that's the reason it's a little  <START:W_Price> pricey <END>  for a AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .One more thing,do avoid general Tao kinda of  <START:Food> dish <END>  ,that was just ridiculous
