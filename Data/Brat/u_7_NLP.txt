This is a  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  spot to grab a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  after work. While the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  didn't change my life, they were  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . Add a reasonable selection of  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and them having the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  on and you have a solid  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .
I was having a craving for Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> .  El Toro is  <START:Opinion> less <END>  than 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  from where I live and based on the reviews  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  seemed like a solid  <START:S_Menu> choice <END> .  I've not yet been to other Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in the area, so I can't say if this is really the best local option.However, based on my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  I would say that  <START:Food> it <END>  is indeed a solid  <START:S_Menu> choice <END> .  No frills, filling  <START:Food> food <END> , with LOTS AND LOTS of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  Oh man.  So much  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  So many  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  I got Vegetarian B (...why do all Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  follow the same formula for their vegetarian  <START:S_Menu> menus <END> ?) and  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> .  I really have no complaints about the  <START:Food> food <END> , and  <START:Food> it <END>  was cheap  <START:Opinion> plus <END>  we had a  <START:Offers> coupon <END> , making  <START:Food> it <END>  even  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was also  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and fast; as in, we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  our  <START:Food> food <END> , and were eating  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:Opinion> less <END>  than 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later.I've had better Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  (oh Plaza Azteca...you're sooo far away right now...) but this wasn't  <START:O_Experience> bad <END>  at all.  The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  leaves something to be desired.   <START:Food> it <END>  was a bit weird and kind of looked like the remains of an  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  person's garage sale.  Nonetheless I enjoyed my  <START:Food> meal <END>  once the screaming children sitting behind us were gone.Oh yeah...and for some bizarre reason  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are bottles on  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END>  on each  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ...no hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  or  <START:Food> anything <END> ...just  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END> ...at a Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ...am I missing something?
I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  because I wanted some  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and I was hungry. Settled on a  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and a  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> intimidating <END>  because  <START:Food> it <END>  came in a  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END> . The next thing that came was the  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  arrived a little different that I was expecting. Most  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  come on the  <START:S_Cutlery> tray <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  on sort of. Well at least the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of  <START:S_Cutlery> tray <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  was made on. You know the standard metal  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> pan <END> . Instead the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  came on a round rack on  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> tray <END> .Then while trying to grab a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  I thought  <START:Food> it <END>  wasn't cut all the way though.  <START:Food> it <END>  look a while to figure out the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  wasn't cut traditionally.  <START:Food> it <END>  was cut every which way. The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> , but  <START:Food> it <END>  doesn't compare to my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Some of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  didn't have  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END>  on  <START:Food> it <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was odd too because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  wasn't a lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  on  <START:Food> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  also wasn't a lot of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .I liked the crust of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  because  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> crunchy <END>  and not  <START:F_FoodItem> soggy <END> . I think I'd try some other  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  if I did go back.  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> , but I'd try something else.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was  <START:F_Dessert> gelato <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two  <START:F_FI_Size> scoops <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> vanilla <END>  and then one  <START:F_FI_Size> scoop <END>  dark  <START:Food> chocolate <END> . The dark  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> vanilla <END>  was a bit sweet for me.
They lose 1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  for not having any hard cider in stock...supposedly they ran out. I can't  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  so I was left to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  a very  <START:F_Drinks> fruity cosmo <END> . Overall,  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  isn't  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:Offers> special <END> . I hear the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  though. One thing going for them is that they have a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> . $3  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and munchies M-F from 3:30 - 6:30. The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is nothing  <START:Offers> special <END> . Bathrooms were clean though and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is plenty of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> .
The  <START:F_Dessert> cheescake <END>  was standard  <START:F_Dessert> cheescake <END>  factory fare, so  <START:Food> it <END>  was above average buy below spectacular. The  <START:Service> service <END> , however was  <START:Service> amazing <END> . Probably better than any other  <START:F_Dessert> chesscake <END>  factory I ahve been too.  courtisy was spilling over by  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  in the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , from the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  to the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  to the busboys. the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  even came over and asked if everything was OK.
Horrible!!! The  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  don't have a clue. Sat  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  just walked by. Waived your hand, they nod and guess what still no one comes by. Unbelievable how  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  functions.
Tony Roma's used to be one of my favorite  <START:Restaurant> spots <END>  as a teenager. Oh nostalgia...Where has the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  gone? Unfortunately, a lot has changed for this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  since then, specifically now with their raised  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  and smaller  <START:A_Places> portions <END> . Oh and can I mention that they don't offer the 4 different  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  anymore? Just  <START:W_Price> more <END>  of an  <START:O_Experience> inconvenience <END>  to have to ask the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  for  <START:Food> it <END> . I guess they're really trying to  <START:Offers> save <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> costs <END> , huh?I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the full  <START:F_FI_Size> slab <END>  of baby back  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  with a side of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> baked <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  ( <START:Food> it <END> 's the only  <START:Food> item <END>  that I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ). Their baby back  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  glazed with their  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  are freakin  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  and has always been freakin  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  are so  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and juicy. However, I feel like their  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  have been gradually decreasing over the years. And I'm confident to say that two full  <START:F_FI_Size> slabs <END>  today would make up a full  <START:F_FI_Size> slab <END>  back in the  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  along with  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END> . Sadly, due to a lot of their changes, I think they lost a lot of business. However, if I'm really craving baby back  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  which isn't very often these  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END> , I will most likely end up coming back  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
The  <START:S_Staff> server <END> / <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> pleasant <END>  but had dirt under his nails.  Was very turned off when he handed me the  <START:Food> food <END> .  They keep  <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  in the back so you cant see them which with  <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  I like to see to know how fresh they are. The  <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  weren't  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  either.
This is our version of Cheers. You know. Where everybody knows our name. This  <START:A_Plc_Bar> pub <END>  is really a versatile  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  changes from  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  dining to  <START:A_Entertainment> sports <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to kick back  <START:A_Plc_Bar> pub <END>  everyday. And its really conducive to all our different circles of friends. The  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> wenches <END>  are all SUPER  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and willing to please. Now that I think about  <START:Food> it <END> , I'm really spoiled by  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> . While we haven't yet memorized the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , we've memorized everything that we like on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Touting myself as a french  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fry <END>  connoisseur, I like to think that Steiner's  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> - <START:F_Ingredients> battered <END>  fries are among the elite. Bf loves the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , extra hot. They also have a  <START:F_Dessert> creme brulee <END> . Its not  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> , but if ever I have a  <START:F_Dessert> creme brulee <END>  craving at 2 in the am ...
Can you say EXCELLENT! I would  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  this better then Ponchos (south Phx) and right on par with Carolinas. Yep you read right. Granted this was my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  but come on  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> ! The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is in a strip  <START:F_FI_Size> mall <END>  south of Peoria on the west side, with other types of Mexican  <START:Restaurant> shops <END>  all around  <START:Food> it <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  fits right in. I had a green chile  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was $4.95,  <START:Food> it <END>  came with  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  too. The  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  was plenty  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  and filled with a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  flavored and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  Green chilie,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with green  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was a white type not the cheddar type. YUMMY The  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  were one of my favorite parts, they were soooo  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . Again  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with the white  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was very  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  and had a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  flavor. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  we re wonderful, anytime you get free  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . They also  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  type dip with the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> . I do not like  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  guac but this was rather  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent,  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and attentive. The  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  area was  <START:F_FI_Size> larger <END>  then expected and was cleaner then CHINO but could still use some  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  updating. Not a fancy type  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I will be back but this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I am bringing my  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> !
One of the best dinners I've had!  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pistachio <END> -crusted  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> , while my  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>  had the  <START:F_FoodItem> puerco lento <END>  (slow- <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> ).  Both were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> !  Since  <START:Food> it <END>  was my birthday, we also had the  <START:Food> chocolate <END> - <START:F_Ingredients> peanut <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .  Oh my!  The buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> carpaccio <END>  app was also a hit.I'd give  <START:Food> it <END>  five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> , but the noise level  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is ridiculous!  The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is a little cool and a bit dark for me, but still a nice   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to spend some  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at, yet we couldn't hear each other speak.  I really do not find shouting conversations enjoyable.
The " <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  Ass"  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  I would recommend that to anyone. This was my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and I was very much pleased. Would definitely come back and have dinner  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
Thanks to Yelp, I was able to find this  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>  and brewery right behind where I stayed at Bally's for CES. For the week I stayed in Vegas, I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  twice. This is saying alot since  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are so many  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  options to choose from on the Strip.  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , the prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  is a must try. I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  rare and mooing.  <START:Food> it <END>  came out  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and very  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> flavorful <END> . All their  <START:Food> entree <END>  comes with a  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . I opted for their  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with house Italian  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END> . Their Italian  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END>  is one of the best I've  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> . I wanted to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  like a shot with what I had left after finishing my  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  but decided against  <START:Food> it <END> . The second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I came, I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> surf and turf <END> , which was an 8 oz. sirloin with butterfly  <START:F_Ingredients> battered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> . Very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . Now the  <START:Service> service <END>  is not the most  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and keep in mind  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a strict rule that they do not allow separation of the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> . We wanted to separate our  <START:O_Payment> bills <END>  but they said NO EXCEPTIONS! If you do want separate  <START:O_Payment> bills <END> , I'd suggest to go as party of one and request to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  next to your friends. This is a loop-hole that I thought might work. Maybe...maybe not. I only had their stout and  <START:Food> it <END>  held  <START:Food> it <END> 's own and was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . If you want  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  at  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END> , don't  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  too much about the  <START:Service> service <END> , this is a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go for a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  dinner without all the extra fluff from Vegas.
I wasn't super impressed with the India Palace  <START:Food> buffet <END> . They had a  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>  interesting selections that I don't usually see at Indian  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  (like malai kofta- yum!), and also a  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>  things that just looked downright unappetizing (the haleem looked really, really unappetizing- and my husband confirmed my suspicions when he, braver than I, gave  <START:Food> it <END>  a try-  <START:Food> it <END>  was gross). The  <START:F_FoodItem> chutneys <END>  were weird and  <START:Food> it <END>  was hard to track down a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  when we needed a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  refill or something. The malai kofta was  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , though, as well as a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  I sampled and I liked the inclusion of  <START:F_FoodItem> samosas <END>  on the  <START:Food> buffet <END> ... but the  <START:F_Dessert> gulab jamun <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like soap and chemicals and overall I just got a weird vibe. We won't be back.
A couple of friends told me about  <START:Restaurant> this spot <END> ... I read the Yelp reviews and finally came to try  <START:Food> it <END>  out. The reviews were right about the  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> !  <START:Food> it <END> 's delish! Lots of fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  and I opted for the  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was MMMM  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> ! I tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> , yellow tail, sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . All of  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  except for the  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  -  <START:Food> it <END>  was SUPER fishy and not  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  at all. Def don't recommend THAT. Everything else was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  though. Also tried a rainbow  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  and the Happy Ending  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are MANY  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  floating around always asking you if you want to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Food> anything <END>  else so  <START:Service> service <END>  is pretty much on point  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  as well. As I was reading the reviews a lot of them said the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  were all TOO  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  together, but apparently they have expanded the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are two  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END> , some awkwardly placed  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  as well, but for the most part  <START:Food> it <END>  was all  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> !
My favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in Las Vegas. My wife and I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we have a craving for  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Their  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , and they don't drown the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in  <START:Food> it <END> . They give a  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  array of  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  and don't skimp on them like the  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>   <START:Restaurant> chains <END> . We're very happy to have found  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  on Yelp!
I have heard such  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  things, but the actual event was so lack luster.  <START:Food> it <END>  look an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  to get our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , I won't even mention how long  <START:Food> it <END>  took for the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  to take our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  wasn't even  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  full so I would hate to see if when they are busy. When the  <START:Food> food <END>  came out,  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  the  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  were wrong. The  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  were odd and very  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  on any  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . The salas were both too  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  to be eaten with the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  which I think were three  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> .NEVER AGAIN
I decided to write a review for  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  but the only problem was that I have not eaten  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in years. So I decided to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  take out last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the drunken  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  with duck. Pros:  <START:Food> it <END>  was as  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  as ever. The  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> . They give you the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  to put over separately, so be careful not to drench  <START:Food> it <END> . The duck was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  as well. The duck was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  and deboned for easy eating. Cons: they didn't give me a pair of  <START:S_Cutlery> chopsticks <END> .This is the benchmark for all thai  <START:Food> food <END> .
My daughter and I found  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  shortly after moving to Charlotte almost 3 years ago and  <START:Food> it <END>  has been our go-to spot ever since.  We've been coming pretty much once a week and never grow  <START:Opinion> tired <END>  of  <START:Food> it <END> .  For the  <START:W_Price> price <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .  We can pig out  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for $30 and when we  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  an equivalent  <START:Food> meal <END>  at a different  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  end up spending $60.  The Firecracker  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  is my favorite, but I also like to sample around the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and try to get something new every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I go.  I also love the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> grilled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> teriyaki <END>  ball.  Their  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  has such  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  flavor and they use  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  rather than  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END> .  This is my daughter's favorite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Charlotte.  When I asked  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  how many  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  to give,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  because the  <START:Food> food <END>  is so  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> .  When a 9-year- <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  says a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a 5- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  then you know  <START:Food> it <END> 's  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> , right?
Mlife black cardholder + free points = No  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> , lots of people throwing shade at you.  Hah!Foodies rejoice, this  <START:Food> buffet <END>  has  <START:Food> it <END>  all.  From  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  to red  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and fancy little  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  in between, how can you not love  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> ?  Probably one of the nicer  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  on The Strip, if not the nicest!   <START:Service> service <END>  is pretty speedy since I'm sure they want you in and out of  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  ASAP.  Come for the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs, the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> , the  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END> , the prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END> , and don't forget  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> !  Bottomless  <START:F_Drinks> mimosas <END>  on Saturday and $20 for a bottle of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  ain't too shabby.  Would I  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  to come and eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ?  Maybe.  Bellagio is an extravagant  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and they charge you for  <START:Food> it <END>  for sure.  Will I enjoy  <START:Food> it <END>  when  <START:Food> it <END> 's free?  Of course!
So  <START:Food> it <END> 's about 6 in the morning and we are leaving Tao Nightclub. LONG  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . Starving. We walk all the way from the Venetian to Palazzo to eat at Grand Lux and find out that we have to go all the way back to Venetian since Palazzo's  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  was  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  and the Venetian  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is the one that is open late. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  hot  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END> , and  <START:Food> it <END>  was a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:A_Places> portion <END>  for an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , though was a little too  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END> . I almost would have prefered  <START:Restaurant> tapas <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:A_Places> portions <END>  for this one since  <START:Food> it <END>  could hardly fit in my mouth, and  <START:Food> it <END>  came with three hot  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END> !One of my friends however,  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , and  <START:Food> it <END>  was SO  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> ! SOOO  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> ! I definitely  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  again when we ate for a second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at the Grand Lux Palazzo right before we left Vegas. At 6 in the morning,  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  was PACKED!  <START:Food> it <END>  might have even been 5AM, but they had a list, and a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Crazy! I was really disappointed about the Kobe hot  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END>  so I had to knock off a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  for that reason, and I really preferred the Palazzo  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  in general.
The  <START:F_Drinks> margaritas <END>  were awful!!  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like all  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  and no  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END> . They charged $11 for essentially a non alcoholic  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END> . They had like 4 dinner  <START:Food> items <END>  on their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  so don't come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  trying to eat dinner.  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> rude <END>  when we asked if they could add  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  since  <START:Food> it <END>  was to  <START:F_FI_Taste> sugary <END>  to even  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . They get 1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> .
Excited about the reviews that  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  had gotten, my friends and I decided to try this out as our "fancy  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> " in Vegas.  The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  was very nice, and I think the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  they used were definitely high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  But somehow, just didn't quite  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  off my tongue like I would've liked.I started off with the Arancine ( <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> ), and while the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  combined with the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , I was not a  <START:Opinion> fan <END>  of the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>  lost the richness of its flavor, while the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END> -ness was just not quite as  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  as say, on a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  or  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  okra.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> -based  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was splendid, however.  For my  <START:Food> entree <END>  I got the short  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> raviolini <END> . Now, I must caveat that I was disappointed with this  <START:Food> entree <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> truffles <END>  I believe) in my  <START:F_FoodItem> raviolini <END> , and I do not like  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> .  However, the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  didn't SAY that  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  would be  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , and I believe that the flavor was strong enough that  <START:Food> it <END>  should've been warned of.  With that sad, I also tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> gnocchi <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> linguine <END> , and the rigatoni.  The rigatoni was the best out of the  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  that I had... overall the  <START:Food> entrees <END>  were pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> , but the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  flavored overwhelmed my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  buds a bit and I wasn't able to enjoy the rest quite as much.While  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  was reasonably  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> , I would definitely recommend Circo at the Bellagio over this.   <START:W_Price> prices <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were comparable from what I remember (went a  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>  months ago), but the  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END>  were far  <START:W_Price> more <END>  delectable.
Went to watch  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  3 of world series on sat afternoon. Had to complain to  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  just to get  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  on 1  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END> , they had espn college football news on 7 screens , got  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  on 3  <START:O_Experience> bad <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> viewing <END>  screens from  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area. Other 7 ppl watching world series left during 4th inn to go elsewhere to watch.   <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  but this is world series.
Not worth the $50. Sure is unlimited  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> , but the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  doesn't even  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was tough, and tasteless.  I actually had to throw one away because  <START:Food> it <END>  smelled terrible, and  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> . The two  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  is for the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> ,  their  <START:F_FoodItem> tiramisu <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> gelato <END>  are  very  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> !
We enjoyed the  <START:S_Cutlery> pan <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roast <END>  and the Gumbo. Both were enjoyable a reasonably  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  for the offering.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:S_Del_Time> timely <END>  and attentive.
Everything I ate  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END>  brunch was excellent, seriously. Usually I leave a lot on my  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  at these  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END> , but not  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs were  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  and I became addicted with that drawn  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were peeled and CLEAN and juicy. Prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  wasn't dry or chewy, just super yummy. All the  <START:Food> food <END>  is high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is so much to choose from. We had a  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>   <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarians <END>  and one vegan and all were very satisfied, so that says something. I picked this out for a group of 21(!!!) girl friends and we were SO happy; they couldn't stop praising me! Also a huge  <START:Opinion> plus <END> , they sat us all together!  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  Market @ Planet Hollywood split us up between 3 far away  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . Boo.Go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  if you're looking for a mid-range brunch  <START:Food> buffet <END> . The end.
 <START:Restaurant> this spot <END>  is Eithopi-ILLIN'! I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a bunch of  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and always come away smiling, belly bursting with spongy Injera that expands in your stomach. LV is a strange  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ...when I walked in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I expected the usual suspects of mangy trustafarians and tatted hipsters but was surprised to find myself dining amongst Ethiopians munching on piles of raw  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> . But aside from scratching that stuffwhitepeoplelike.com itch to eat an ethnic  <START:Food> meal <END>  without any other whities in site, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is stand-up: excellent Doro Wat, Tibs, all the usual stuff. Funny though one of the "vegetarian"  <START:Food> items <END>  has ground  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  in  <START:Food> it <END> . My only complaint is they don't have Ethiopian  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , or Hej -- Ethiopian honey  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , a sweet alcoholic delight which appeals to the sorority girl in me (Deltas for life!). But they  <START:Service> treat <END>  ya nice enough to make you forget about any of that.  <START:Opinion> plus <END>  they redid the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  recently so now you have this absurd Saturday- <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> -Fever-looking panel  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  in with the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining-hall <END>   <START:A_Decor> decor <END> , creating a schizophrenic  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  that somehow makes the  <START:Food> food <END>  tastier. Maybe I'm too forgiving -- I just feel like I'm eating a REAL  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  by REAL people  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . And  <START:Food> it <END>  makes me happy and sated. What else can you ask for?
The Vig has a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> ! I've come at non happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , and  <START:Food> it <END>  is pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> ... however, the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are somewhat high for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . Their  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are also  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .The  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . I have had a  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> rude <END>   <START:S_Staff> server <END>  a  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  or two, but I've also had very sweet  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  too.And their  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  on Sunday morning are nice!
The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is an absolute trainwreck. And  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's why: The  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  started with a 35  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> , while tight shirted MMA wannabes  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  the "VIP" doorman to let them and their 30 closest friends in before us. We were in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  so long that people in front of us bailed and  <START:Food> it <END>  seemed like every person leaving was yelling to those of us in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  about how horrid the scene was inside.But we decided to stay because we had always enjoyed the one in north Scottsdale.  <START:O_Experience> bad <END>  idea. Once we finally got up to the doorman, he gave us the "whatever" distant stare and held his hand up in a "I'm holding an ID" move. No hello, or  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  to sandbar. Then they charged us $5, which would be fine if the girl collecting the  <START:W_Price> cash <END>  wasn't also cold and unattentive. But whatever, we're in let's have some fun! Wrong. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was busy but not packed, making us pretty angry that we were in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  so long. But still we couldn't get a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . We flagged down 3 different  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  (who all had the exact same huge upper bodies,  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  legs and spiky hair) until the ONE person  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  doing their job approached us.  <START:Food> it <END>  was a small  <START:S_Staff> female <END>   <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  who was sweating and sprinting around the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  while  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  male counterparts sat around discussing the merits of the Jersey Shore and spray on tans. We had a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and walked around. The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is dull and unimpressive, the bouncers were all busy talking to girls, the  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  has super low celings and  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END> , the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  looks like you're at a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  in Rocky Point that was  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  built but opened anyways. The  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  was pretty awful too. Lots of bumping with no "excuse me", tons of way too drunk people and very, very poor on the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  to girl ratio. After a failed attempt to get another  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , we left the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , confident that not only will we not return to this poorly designed, awfully mismanaged  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , but we will avoid the other sandbars at all  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  as well. Sorry to be a downer, I was anticipating a really fun  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  at a new  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , and  <START:Food> it <END>  ended up just being a complete waste of our  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
Don't let the hole-in-the- <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  keep you away! I LOVE  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> . The japanese lasagna  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  is  <START:Service> amazing <END> . A must try!  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END>  too.
This is one of my  <START:F_FI_Taste> fav <END>   <START:Restaurant> spots <END>  in South Side.  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are reasonably  <START:W_Price> priced <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> , and even though I don't usually like  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , their  <START:Food> food <END>  is really  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> !! I love watching the Pens  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  because of the  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  screen!! I went once for a Trivia  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and  <START:Food> it <END>  was packed and so much fun!
The best  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  I have ever had. And I have worked at 2  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  places. I recommend the  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  crust  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .  <START:Food> it <END> 's  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  enough to not need  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  than that! Also, the  <START:Service> service <END>  is personal and they have a  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END> - <START:W_Price> price <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> . And we got a birthday  <START:F_FoodItem> cannoli <END> !
Very  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  panang  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> .   <START:Food> it <END>  has a complex flavor and the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  is right.  Other  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  too.  Don't let the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  appearance scare you; Inside is simple and clean.   <START:Service> service <END>  is laid-back, so be prepared to stay a little bit longer than you might at some sit-down places, but they'll work with you if you let them know you can't stay long.
Any  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  where I can  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , watch the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and play trivia all while breathing in the goodness of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> smoke <END> -free oxygen  <START:Opinion> deserves <END>  at least 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . Forget about everything else,  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  has a strict no smoking policy and that makes me a very happy person. I stopped in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  Tuesday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  around 7ish and b-dubs was packed. The happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  was just starting to filter out so I was able to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . The  <START:A_Furniture> stools <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  are so much better if you can snag one. The  <START:A_Furniture> stools <END>  around the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  don't have backs and they suck. If you're going to be  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for any amount of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  get a barstool that you can at least lean back in. Tuesday is 45 cent  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  lots of   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  in different  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> . My favorites are mango habanero which is my "go-to" and jammin  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeno <END>  which I had never  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  before but loved. The  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  are very small so I usually  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END>  than I normally would at other  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  joints. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is pretty average, about what you would expect from any popular  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> . I like the smokeless  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and lots of little  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  in different  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> , so for that, I'll go back.
I'm getting hot n juicy reminiscing about the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  in  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . When you're tempted, just remember that  <START:Food> it <END> 's not socially acceptable to feast on  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  on the full flight home.
Some of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  you can find around. Hands down.I found  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  out a year ago and go back when I can. Business seems to be picking up cause I now find  <START:Food> it <END>  pretty busy during afternoons and  <START:S_OpenHours> evenings <END> . This  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  totally  <START:Opinion> deserves <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  too.I recommend the Kahuna  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  or Rumbi  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . Both are  <START:Service> amazing <END> , and come with the secret "Rumbi"  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .
Today was my first  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  dining  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and I met to celebrate two birthdays together while enjoying a  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  dinner.  I can't think of one negative thing about our complete dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  from the  <START:Food> food <END>  to the  <START:Service> service <END> .  Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  Mark was hands down one of the best  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  I have ever had  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .  He was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> outgoing <END>  and knowledgeable, and just took  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  of our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  from start to finish.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly!  This will be my go to barbecue joint from this point on in the east valley area!!
5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for our  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  Cooper and our  <START:Food> food <END> ! This is my second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to come back. We sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and we got the blood  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>  Cosmo which was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and strong. And then we had calamari which was so lightly  <START:F_FoodItem> breaded <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  marinara  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  especially their complimentary dinner  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  that came with some type of  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  and home made  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> . Cooper was  <START:Service> amazing <END> , attentive, funny, and easy going. In fact all the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was the same. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was only $20 and our Cosmo came out to $14 and all so worth  <START:Food> it <END> ! The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is so nice and calm. This is my type of  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
Count me as one  <START:W_Price> more <END>  reviewer that thinks  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is both  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END> .#13 Italian ftw
WOW! This  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is  <START:Service> amazing <END> .  I had the 7 oz  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , fries, and a creamsicle  <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was juicy and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  was soft, and overall  <START:Food> it <END>  was just  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  The  <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END>  was simply  <START:Service> amazing <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like i was eating a creamsicle, but better. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was fast and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .  The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was nice, but casual, not  <START:A_Env_Type> formal <END> . I would recommend this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  to anyone wanting a  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .
So I love Thai  <START:Food> food <END> !  Take this with the grain of  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  considering I only  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  Pad Thai and  <START:F_FoodItem> curries <END> .  Yea, yea...I should branch out...but  <START:Food> it <END> 's so difficult when you like something so much.So how does the Viet Thai  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  House stack up?  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Pad Thai and was very pleased.   <START:Food> it <END>  was definitely different from the Pad Thai I've been accustomed to...but I usually get  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ...so maybe the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  threw  me off.  Anyhow, a friend and I both  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the same  <START:Food> dish <END>  with a hot rating of 3.  I couldn't have loved  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END> ...perfect amount of heat for me.  I do however...really enjoy heat...so a 3 may not be a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  idea for someone new to Thai  <START:Food> food <END> .  Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'll try a 4...but  <START:Food> it <END>  scares me a bit.The inside of the VTNH was exactly what I expected...well...except for the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  tanks.  The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  and  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  are casual and simple.   <START:Food> it <END> 's not a five- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> ...but I haven't had better Thai  <START:Food> food <END>  in years.  I will definitely be going back...in fact...I'm wondering if  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and dinner at the same  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  on the same  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  would be crossing the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> .Try:  The Pad Thai  (The Pho looked  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> ...but I didn't try  <START:Food> it <END> )Avoid:  Finding  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  on your own...ask a friend or call the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for directions.
So we had a layover in Charlotte,NC on our way to Jamaica. About two  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  just enough  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to get to the next terminal, Because  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is packed. In the sea of people rushing to their next flight, I see a Familiar red and white bag in a gentleman's hand. The first thing that came to my mind was Bojangles. And while the Colonel ran "Bo" out of Kentucky, I still hold a  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in my belly for Mr Bojangles. What you find  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is what you expect, fast, hot and fresh. Almost forget to mention  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  is quick, not sure if the person was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> , because i couldn't understand what  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said. I think  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said, may I make you over, so I just Gave  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and my  <START:Food> food <END>  somehow found  <START:Food> it <END> 's way into my hand. Love that red and yellow sign
Don't be scared off by the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  that snakes out the door, down the stairs and around the corner - this means the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Service> amazing <END>  (and  <START:Food> it <END> 's worth the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> ). If the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  is not your thing (you'll  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  a bit even if you have a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END> ),  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  takeout, and you'll be in and out in just a  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  flat.  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the chana samosa, baighan bharta, and the shahi paneer (these are all my favourites).  <START:Food> it <END> 's hard to go wrong, though, so peruse the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  until you find something that strikes your fancy. Go at  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to take advantage of the $5 vegetarian thali. Pair  <START:Food> it <END>  with a mango lassi and you've got a  <START:Food> stellar <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> . This is a hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  spot so don't expect linen tablecloths and a fine dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . What you'll get instead is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , a  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:S_Staff> server <END>  and some  <START:Food> stellar <END>  people-watching moments. BYOW.
Horrible customer  <START:Service> service <END> ,  I love the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  but won't go back due to their terrible customer  <START:Service> service <END> .
The  <START:Service> service <END>  was very slow despite the long  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  did not  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  fresh at all.  I was lacking options but I should have just gone to the smoothies  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
My absolute favorite  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat when on the West Coast.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is NOTHING better than a Double Double with  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , Animal Style! I'm not  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  into the fries, and your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  WILL take a while to be made, but  <START:Food> it <END>  is totally worth  <START:Food> it <END> . I introduced my boyfriend to this while we were in LA and he's in love. Counting the  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>  until I return to the US for that  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> !
Went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  with a party of 9 on a Saturday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . <START:A_Environment> environment <END> :  Sinatra has a very nice  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> .  Classy photos of Frank hung up,  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>   <START:A_Furniture> windows <END>  with a clear  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  into an atrium with  <START:A_Decor> lights <END> .  Has an  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  school classic feel. <START:Food> food <END> :  I had a Paloma to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , which was delish.  The clam  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , was decent but didn't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  fresh.  I had the halibut for dinner, so, so dry.  My side by side dinner companions both  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  my  <START:Food> dish <END>  and confirmed,  <START:Food> it <END>  was the worst  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  they have ever had.   <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like cardboard.  I'm not sure if this is the  <START:A_Decor> theme <END>  for the  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END> , because the  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  before we ate at Andreas and  <START:Food> it <END>  was also dry.  Horrible horrible  <START:Food> food <END> . <START:Service> service <END> :   <START:Service> service <END>  was tolerable but not the best.  I did give one additional  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  for providing separate checks.  Sinatra also added on tip, when Andrea's didn't.  Inconsistent policies.  Would not go back, nor recommend.
We saw  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  on  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Stakeout, so when a Groupon came up we bought one. Overall for the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  I think we would go somewhere on the strip instead.  <START:Food> it <END>  was odd to me that they had  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  crammed in one section of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  instead of opening the other side. The  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  we had were fresh and  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  nd I also liked that we could get a  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of any  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END>  for an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> . They were okay, pretty salty though. We both had the  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  eye Oscar style.  <START:Food> it <END>  was okay, not the best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and I didn't realize their Oscar style wasn't with lump  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  but instead another  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> ...so I was way over the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END>  by then!Overall  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  but again for the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  (without a groupon) I know  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are much better  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in this town.
Yummy- <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  on menue
Love love love  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> ! I never have a  <START:O_Experience> bad <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is excellent. This  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in the Boca Park shopping center. For customers they offer free valet  <START:S_Parking> parking <END> . If you don't feel like valet, they have a private lot for  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  or  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  garage.I love to start with the "Avocado Eggrolls" and if you have never tried them you must! They were  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  at $10.50 and can easily be shared.  My favorite thing to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  for my  <START:Food> meal <END>  is the "Carlton  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ".  <START:Food> it <END>  is huge but I manage to polish off every last  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  because the awesome flavor keeps my fork going back for  <START:W_Price> more <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  at $13.95 which is fair for the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  and amount of fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> fruits <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  in  <START:Food> it <END> .The only problem is I never have  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for one of their many  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  of fabulous  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  so I pick one to-go. This last visit  <START:Food> it <END>  was a hard  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  but they are all so  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  I new I couldn't go wrong with the "Reese's  <START:F_Ingredients> peanut <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> ".  If you don't feel like eating inside or  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> , you can phone in your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  for pick up. They say to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in your car and they will bring out your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  but if I phone in a  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  I usually just go inside and pick  <START:Food> it <END>  up because they are always so doggone busy.  I noticed on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  they offer  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> catering <END> .
Went for  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was busy and loud, but decent  <START:Service> service <END>  and the  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  didn't disappoint.
 <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END> .  The best  <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END>  I've had in a long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  Love the cherry  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> .
I was pleasantly surprised by  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> ! I'm a Texan so I'm always skeptical when my Vegas relatives suggest Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> . :) The  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ! Also the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  dip and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  were  <START:Service> amazing <END> !
My third visit was as equally pleasing as the first and second! This  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END>  I enjoyed the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END> 's  <START:Offers> special <END>  of escolar encrusted with pignolias and thyme  <START:Service> served <END>  over  <START:F_FoodItem> polenta <END>  with haricot vert in a  <START:F_Drinks> balsamic <END>  reduction. Everything was perfectly prepared. The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  was warm,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> flavorful <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , excellently  <START:Offers> seasoned <END>  without being overpowered by herbs. The  <START:F_FoodItem> polenta <END>  was soft and creamy while not to rich and the green  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END>  and bright. I paired this  <START:Food> dish <END>  with one of the numerous excellent  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  that they had on  <START:Offers> special <END>  that  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . This was the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  that I ate at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is as  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and attentive as the  <START:S_Staff> waitstaff <END> . I have also sampled the buckwheat savory  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END> . While the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  are excellent and savory, I think that the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  could use  <START:Opinion> less <END>  mixing a bit  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  in the  <START:S_Cutlery> pan <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END>  seems overworked and under  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> , but this could have just been the batch that I received. Friends on subsequent visits have had better preps for sure. The whole  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  (of which you get  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END> ) is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  in a mirepoix reduction with  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  succotash. I would like to see this pared with other  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  as an option. Additionally the french  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  are very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and the  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are enormous! The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is not huge but  <START:Food> it <END>  certainly is diverse and reasonably  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is something for  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END> , from the Vegan to the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  eating carnivore. The only two complaints I have about this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  are the climate and the noise. The  <START:A_Places> space <END>  is small and fun but  <START:Food> it <END>  can get very warm in the hotter months. Dress casual and cool for  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  if you go when  <START:Food> it <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END> . Heat is a consistent problem  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . The noise could be a problem if you are looking for a quiet intimate  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for a  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END> . This is a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  local for a group of friends or a fun second/third  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>  no doubt.(ForkOver is a Foodie transplant from Brooklyn NY searching out and writing about what's to eat in Charlotte, NC)
I have been wanting to get over to GFOM for quite a while to check  <START:Food> it <END>  out.  So finally, I was in the  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>  around  6  <START:S_OpenHours> pm <END>  and decided to stop in for a  <START:F_Drinks> beverage <END>  and an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> .  I perused the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and decided to try the Green  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  Mussels. I absolutely loved the green  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  broth and the mussels that were perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . This was  <START:Service> served <END>  with a side of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END> , which was quickly gone as I used  <START:Food> it <END>  to sop up that  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> . Thankfully, one of the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  noticed that my  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was gone and brought me some  <START:W_Price> more <END>  so that I could enjoy  <START:W_Price> more <END>  of the yummy  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  broth after all my mussels were gone. I love the décor of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and on a quiet  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> , this would be a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  However, since I was by myself on this visit, I chose to sit at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . On the  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  of my visit Jonathan the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  was very attentive and made sure I had everything I needed to enjoy my visit.  I didn't try any of the  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , but I definitely saw some  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  looking concoctions on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  If you have not yet been over to GFOM, you should stop in sometime to give them a try. If you want to avoid the  <START:A_Env_Type> crowds <END>  that were mentioned by the other reviewers, do like I did and head over  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  early.
Best  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in town
The following is a precautionary tale.As I was eating, I started to think about what I would write as a review. And  <START:Food> it <END>  was going to be pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> , you know... for the money that is.  <START:Food> it <END> 's cheap for an all you can eat setting. Everything was going well until I went to the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END> . And I found myself face to face with the two dirtiest crustiest urinals I have ever witnessed in a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Let's get something straight right off the bat, they don't clean  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . If they're not cleaning the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END>  (something we can see) what makes you think they're cleaning the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen>   kitchen?  <END> ?A fellow Yelper mentions that the Kanda on Bishop has failed multiple  <START:Food> food <END>  safety inspections.I even took a  <START:A_Decor> picture <END> , and I considered posting  <START:Food> it <END> . But this isn't the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , you'll have to take my word for  <START:Food> it <END> .
A  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  as filling and satisfying as a Thanksgiving dinner!After spending 12 years living in Southeast Asia  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is one simple  <START:Food> meal <END>  that I miss most, a simple  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> .Pho Saigon 8 will be my local  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  for authentic Asian  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . Their  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END>  are spot on.I had the Pho Tai Chin, rare and well  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are two  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  options, small or  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  for .50 cents  <START:W_Price> more <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  double the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of the small and is helmet  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> steaming <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of satisfying  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  goodness. Before the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  arrives the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>   <START:S_Delivery> delivers <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  condiments that you can use to customize your  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END> , don't be shy, add them all, the flavors and freshness they add lifts the  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  to a heavenly level. Also, don't forget to  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  things up with a healthy squirt of Sriracha and a salty dose of hoisin  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is also a wickedly delightful  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that adds a solid hit of heat,  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  and a touch of sour.The rare  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> sliced <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  sirloin rests on  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>  of the perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> . Once you stir the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  into the  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END> , the rare  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  becomes  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  well in the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> steaming <END>  hot broth,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , fresh - scrumptious.The depth of flavors is uber stimulating to the palate and the sheer volume of  <START:Food> food <END>  is tummy satisfying. You may need a nap if you finish the whole  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END> !My wife enjoyed the Hu tieu hay Mi Dac Biet ( <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> ).  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  agreed, a fantastic,  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , satisfying  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  and curly.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  commented that the  <START:F_FoodItem> squid <END>  was fresh and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly.For an authentic  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of Southeast Asia, Pho Saigon 8 can't be beat.Their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is extensive and includes many other non- <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  that we will certainly be returning to try. We just couldn't handle  <START:Food> anything <END>  else on  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>  of our hot tub  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> !Aloha!
The only reason that I didn't give five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  is because I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  take out  <START:W_Price> more <END>  often than I stay and sit, so I can't speak to the  <START:Service> service <END> . Their pad see ew is the best that in the Burgh and their yellow  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  as well. The last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the pad Thai,  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END> , but  <START:Food> it <END> 's been  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  before so I could've caught the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen>   kitchen?  <END>  on an off  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  is also  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I'm a huge  <START:Opinion> fan <END>  of pho and Thai and the broth in this  <START:Food> dish <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , warm, and  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  even by itself.
Typical  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  Pick your  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and pick your  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  (4 are included,  <START:W_Price> more <END>  than 4 is additional $).  3  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  of fries.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are a  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>  other offerings on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area and a dining area.  They only  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> .   <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> .  Overall, a little bit pricey for what you get.  I had a Groupon.
While in Vegas I visited Lola's A Louisiana  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen>   kitchen?  <END>  on Charleston near "Downtown LV"and tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  Gumbo and I must say I had a orgasm in my mouth lol !!! The Gumbo was authentic Louisiana gumbo I give that  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  a rating of 10+++ me and the hubby killed that little  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of Gumbo. When in Vegas visiting check Lola's out you won't be disappointed :-)
I've had Indian in London, in Germany, in California and this is hands down still my favorite Indian spot. The  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END>  for a reason;  <START:Food> it <END>  is an excellent value. The  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is around $7.Not only is the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> , the  <START:Service> service <END>  is impeccable. I can't remember a  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  that I ever had an empty glass of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  or an empty  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  ready to be taken from the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  for  <START:W_Price> more <END>  than a  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  levels in the pans are also closely monitored by  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  so they are never out of  <START:Food> anything <END> . <START:Food> it <END>  gets slammed at  <START:Food> lunch <END>  so I usually come when they first open.When are we getting an Uptown  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> ???
 <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> , unless you're in a rush. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , fresh, organic, and local.  <START:Food> it <END> 's all vegan and vegetarian fare with lots of gluten-free options. On  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>  of this, everything  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .The biggest drawback is how painfully slow the  <START:Service> service <END>  is. Getting  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  and placing  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  takes no  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at all, but be prepared to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  a  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  while for your  <START:Food> food <END>  to get to you.
Another  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  at Mitchell's Not many options for  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  in south hills
I'm so glad I found  <START:Restaurant> this spot <END> . Usually when I stay in the area I have to resort to Starbucks. Sambalatte has  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> .
Was excited to go back... Not sure if ownership changed w name... But tried camelback  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  and original since 1st review... Just NOT the same.  Sad was so  <START:Service> amazing <END> ... Disappointing when not consistent
 <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .   <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .   <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> buns <END> .   <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> .   <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  rings.Terrible complimentary popcorn.Similar to Hoppdoddy's in Austin, Tx but not quite as  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  and I don't know that  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  are local or organic.
Nice  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  was lacking . I had the 8 layer  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ..  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and the red sangria smooth and the myan  <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END>  was their  <START:Offers> saving <END>  grace.
 <START:Food> it <END> 's a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  better then mcdonalds and  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  King. Like that they do the "fat  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frys <END> " also known as  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  fries! Don't see them in to many places. They will do extras on your  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  that you don't see to much either like  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> . All in all not the best not the worst. Something to throw in the belly while wasting your life savings!!!!
Best pot  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roast <END>  I've tried!
Their custom built  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  are the best!!  ... You wont find  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  like this at In-n-Out or those other boring  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  places ... They offer a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of selections, their  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  is  <START:Service> amazing <END> , even their  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  look  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , (and they have homeade  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END>   <START:A_Decor> dressing <END> , not that plactic tasting  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  in a bottle  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END>   <START:A_Decor> dressing <END> ) also they're  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are really  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  too. ... Give them a try, you wont be disappointed.
A very reasonable Thai  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in the heart of Shadyside.   <START:Food> it <END>  pains me every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we walk by  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> , because  <START:Food> it <END>  looks so empty compared to Mad Mex.  But really, people, you should give Kanok a chance!  The pad thai was one of the best we've had in the Burgh so far, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> curries <END>  are done well.  Add to that sophisticated  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  and gracious  <START:Service> service <END>  (and not having to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:Opinion> plus <END>  having to scream over the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  at your eating companions) - what's not to like?My only  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  about the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is their  <START:W_Price> pricing <END>  -  <START:Food> it <END>  seems somewhat out of  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  with other Thai places in the area.   <START:Food> it <END> 's a little on the high side, but still worth  <START:Food> it <END> .
 <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> ! My boyfriend and I walked in and  <START:Food> it <END>  seemed  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END> . That wasn't the case once we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and found a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  was a bit overwhelming for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  being  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . I decided on the farmers market bene and I don't regret that decision.  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  was excellent and was self  <START:S_Staff> serve <END> . The only thing I found to be weird was that  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were no  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END> /silverware on the counters. When the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  bring the  <START:Food> food <END>  is when they  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  and silverware are given out. Besides that, everything went swimmingly.
The hot  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END>  are  <START:Service> amazing <END> !!! My favorite is the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  bulgogi  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  and the carne asada fries. Everything I've tried  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> !
Even thinking about  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  gives me a stomach ache.Where to begin, The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was fine, I liked the cheesy  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on the outdated  <START:A_Ent_Tv> televisions <END> , but thats about  <START:Food> it <END>  . At first their whole hospital  <START:A_Decor> themed <END>  gimmick was cute then just got hugely annoying. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was completely unattentive and even  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> rude <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is NO  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> , which you will be begging for after a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of their sodium packed but tasteless  <START:Food> food <END> . After a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of their  <START:F_FoodItem> soggy <END>  flavorless  <START:Food> food <END>  and too thick and rich  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_Drinks> shake <END>  I was ready to leave. I am a HUGE  <START:Opinion> fan <END>  of  <START:Food> anything <END>  that tacky and greasy  <START:Food> food <END> . But all their  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  filled  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  were all gratitious and adds nothing to the flavor of  the  <START:Food> food <END> . I have a stomach of steel and  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  left me with an upset stomach. AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The  <START:Food> food <END>  is ok the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are a bit on the high side and they could definitely use some help on keeping the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  clean  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  were dirty garbage on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END> 
 <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  Not sure what impressed me  <START:W_Price> more <END>   - the  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  or the warm and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:Service> service <END> .  Found Barrio Queen while walking around aimlessly  (I'm from out of town ) and was extremely pleased.  Tge fush  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  were hot,  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END> ,  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  Accompanied by a Dos Sequis Amber,  I had a perfect combination.  I'll definitely be back.
Tried their shio ramen along with a side  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> .  After sitting down,  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  was taken quickly, and my hot  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  off three  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  before my  <START:Food> meal <END>  arrived.  From  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , things started going  <START:Opinion> downhill <END>  a bit.  I had to move myself to a different spot on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  because  <START:Food> it <END>  was so dark, I couldn't see what was in my  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END> .  The first sip of a  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of ramen did not trigger all those wonderful memories of  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  ramen  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END> .  For a shio ramen, the broth was definitely lighter in  <START:Food> texture <END> , not unlike  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> .  I know they say  <START:Food> it <END> 's stock from over 24  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> boiling <END>  black  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  bones.  But the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  is definitely infused with too concentrated  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  of a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of vegies.  And the after  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  hung around too long on the palates, not like the deep  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  after  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  from savory fats, but from something  <START:W_Price> more <END>  like MSG, or concentrated condiments.  If shio ramen is oil painting, I believe they  <START:Service> served <END>   <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   <START:A_Decor> colors <END> .  My tongue was confused, and thirsty from the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , and now that I needed  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> ,  <START:Food> it <END>  stopped coming.The high notes of vegies did not stop  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  curiously had a strong  <START:F_Ingredients> carrot <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  paste  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , unlike any Japanese  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> .  At the end, I had to ask the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> , is the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  Japanese?Like all  <START:Food> foods <END>  made with instant condiments, or chemicals,  <START:Food> it <END>  actually " <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END> " pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> .  I do not have any evidence that their  <START:Food> food <END>  didn't go through long  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  of preparation so if I have offended anyone, particularly  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  or  <START:S_Staff> chef <END> , I do apologize.  But I do challenge that in the tradition of a  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  ol'  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of ramen, the convenience of offering customers, hey if you think  <START:Food> it <END> 's too  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  we have stuff to make  <START:Food> it <END>  heavier, or if too heavy, we have stuff to  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  down, etc perhaps is too wishy washy.  Take a stance on Ramen Sora's take of what a shio ramen should  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like and present us with That.
Lately, I've been telling people that Fukumimi is the best ramen around and beats Monta hands down. This was before I finally tried Ramen Sora.Earlier today, my friend said he was  <START:Opinion> tired <END>  of eating at home and suggested that we eat out for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . After some deliberations, we went  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . We arrived shortly before the 11:30 opening  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  a bit before walking in. We were the second  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  for the  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> , which felt even better when I later saw people loitering in the  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  area before  <START:Food> it <END>  had even hit noon. Having browsed through some Yelp reviews (love you  <START:S_Staff> guys <END> ), I chose the Deluxe Sora Ramen ($10) with  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  broth, while my friend had the standard  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  Ramen ($7.50).A  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later, heaven arrived. I don't know how else to describe the excellent, salty and umami broth, the al dente  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  (best I've personally experienced), the generous  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  (you  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  what you're  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for in this one), the chewy-but-not-too-chewy bamboo shoots, the green  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> , and the seaweed squares. I did find the  <START:F_FoodItem> yolk <END>  of the soft- <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> boiled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  to be a bit runny compared to what I'm used to. Just based off the components that appear to be present in the normal  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  ramen, I would have been happy. I was smiling inside the whole  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .Unfortunately, my friend did not find his ramen as much to his liking. I could kinda tell by how much broth he left behind. His  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  complaint is that  <START:Food> it <END> 's too salty, and I agree that the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  is a very strong component. However, I happen to be pretty  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> -tolerant (at least compared to someone like my mom), so this is not a negative for me at all. If  <START:Food> it <END>  is an issue for you, then steer clear (or ask about clear broth on the side, I saw in another review).I was just so impressed today that I've decided that Sora is now #1. Fukumimi is still a very  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  second for me, with emphasis on the  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END> : if I'm leaving from home, then I want to pick Fukumimi for a shorter drive. If I'm around Spring Mountain and need a  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,  <START:Food> it <END> 's gotta be Ramen Sora. And I'm still smiling.
Best  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  I've ever had.  How can you go wrong?  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  belly,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to perfection with gruyere  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> caramelized <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  and baconaise all nestled between a  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END> .  Soooo  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> !  My friend had the Drunk  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  crust sandwhich that was equally as  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  Can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back for dinner with my hubby!
 <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  was just plain strange. Started by walking into a completely dead first  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  with about 4  <START:S_Staff> hostesses <END>  just staring at me. I walked upstairs to meet a friend at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and I swear  <START:Food> it <END>  felt like  <START:Food> it <END>  had the feel of an empty Applebee's. The  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was also just pure insanity. If someone told me to come up with a mix of the crappiest songs from the fifties and the late eighties; I wouldn't have come  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to the poor selection they offered. After about twenty  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  of joking about  <START:Food> it <END> ; they changed  <START:Food> it <END>  to something bearable. Even though the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection was worse than the Citgo down the street; the  <START:Service> service <END>  was actually decent. Gotta hand  <START:Food> it <END>  to them- they were making the best out of a pretty  <START:O_Experience> bad <END>  situation. Not sure how this one gets turned around but someone let me know if that miracle happens and I'll give  <START:Food> it <END>  another shot.
I love  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> , I told my friend I had an urge for  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  suggested  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> .  This was  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  go to  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and I can see why.  Its only sad because Seattle doesn't have an  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  like this.  Anyways, during my trip, I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  twice and was blown away by the  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> .  The heat rating system was new to me since  <START:Food> it <END>  went  <START:Food> it <END>  to 10.  I had 7 twice and might actually bump up to 10 next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> !  Both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , I got  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  with some sort of protein.  My favorite would have to be the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  since I like  <START:F_Ingredients> stewed <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> .  This with the sides of almond slivers,  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END>  veg.  I feel refuel and  ready to tackle the Sin City again.
One of the best  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:Restaurant> shops <END>  in Phoenix, but when the pricks behind the counter tell you they won't make you a doppio over  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END> , I want to punch them straight in the baby maker. When I'm  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  don't tell me what I can and cannot have, I'm boycotting until they get over themselves.
My husband and I went to dinner at Tom Yum this  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END>  because I had a craving for Thai  <START:Food> food <END>  and remembered  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  had opened recently, so we decided to try  <START:Food> it <END> .  When we got in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  the ' <START:S_Staff> hostess <END> ' told us that we could sit where we wanted (from across the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> ), but this didn't bother me as  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was on  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  way to put an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in to the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen>   kitchen?  <END> .Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and informed me as I received my  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  that earlier in the week the  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  and diet syrups were  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  up so if  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  off to let  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  know...  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  comped the  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  for me.  We were having a hard  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  picking what we wanted to try, so we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Satay as an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  before we placed our  <START:Food> entree <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  came out right as we were  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  our  <START:Food> entrees <END>  (very quick).  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Broccoli  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  heat and my husband  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Pad Thai  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  heat.   <START:Food> it <END>  took longer than I had expected to get the  <START:Food> food <END>  since we were one of three  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> , but we were  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  fairly late and  <START:Food> it <END>  seemed  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were only one or two people in the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen>   kitchen?  <END> . When we received our  <START:Food> food <END>  we were blown away at how  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> !!  Both the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  and our  <START:Food> entrees <END>  were phenomenal.  Perfect amount of spiciness, temperature of  <START:Food> food <END> , consistency of  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> ,  <START:Food> texture <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , etc.  Everything was perfect.  Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was very attentive throughout the entire  <START:Food> meal <END> .  All in all, Tom Yum surpassed my expectations and we will definitely be returning soon, and often, to enjoy  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  Thai  <START:Food> food <END> .
Two  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>  in a row!! Two!!  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:Service> service <END> , nice  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> , excellent  <START:Food> food <END> , FREAKING  <START:Service> amazing <END>  Bloody Mary's....I've found a new  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  spot in Gilbert!!Our first visit was a  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>  for the hubs and I. He had been wanting to check  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  out but thought the only one that existed was in Arcadia. I mentioned I had driven by the one on Warner and since we had other plans in Tempe that  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> , we decided to check  <START:Food> it <END>  out. We arrived around 9:30am on a Friday and were promptly  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> . During our  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> , an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  or so,  <START:Food> it <END>  really filled up.I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the chiliquilles. I asked our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  what he recommended between those and the  <START:F_Ingredients> corned <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  hash. The  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  and I filed up quickly. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  stayed  <START:F_FoodItem> crunchy <END>  through the whole  <START:Food> meal <END> ...nothing worse than  <START:F_FoodItem> soggy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> . Blech! Not wanting to get loaded first thing in the morning (and therefore sleepy), we chose to split a Mary's en Fuego.  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeno <END>   <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END> , Bloody Mary mix, bacon bits,  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  Bay rim. YUM!  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  and so, so  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . Highly recommended.On the next visit we brought the kids.  They loved their  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> . This  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went with the  <START:F_Ingredients> corned <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  hash. Meh. Small  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  and not a lot of flavor. The chiliquilles is where  <START:Food> it <END> 's at. Oh...and another Bloody Mary.
I come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and the pretzel fondue! Culinary is right in the middle of things in Scottsdale and  <START:Food> it <END>  is a fun  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> /dinner before a  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  out on the town.  <START:Food> it <END>  is trendy, upbeat and has live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on weekends, which can also make  <START:Food> it <END>  pretty loud. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  too, but not a ton of options for those (like me) who don't eat  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . I have never come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and not started with the pretzel fondue (they're  <START:Service> amazing <END> ) and my go to  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Food> item <END>  is usually the Ahi  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .
Love this  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  going to rage extremely hard and these  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  support my drinking habits!!!
I don't understand how people can  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  so high. Came in greeters were awesome, was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  and then came the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  was alright a bit salty, the hit  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is the flaming fajitas which they douse in  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  oil in  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to  <START:A_Decor> light <END> . We did really enjoy the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  chile  <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  however we did not receive  <START:Service> amazing <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  like most if the reviews. They took ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to get our  <START:F_Drinks> waters <END>  and soft  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , and the pina colada my dad  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  was pretty much  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  chunks and  <START:F_Drinks> milk <END> . After receiving our  <START:Food> meal <END>  we had to flag them down to get refills and extra  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  or what not. Definitely not a high chance of returning.
Very clean eating. So many  <START:Food> food <END>  combinations that can be created  <START:Food> it <END>  would take a while to get through all of them.  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was patient with me since  <START:Food> it <END>  was my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . Will definitely eat  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again.
Middle America takes a lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  from the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> -eating, wheatgrass-farting, vegan, Prius-driving type people on the coasts. But people on the coasts don't know what  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  barbecue is because, well, they don't have  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  barbecue on the coasts. To be fair, when  <START:Food> it <END>  comes to  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , wheatgrass, hybrids and  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END> , Madison is  <START:W_Price> more <END>  similar to the coasts than Memphis, KC, South Carolina, or Austin. That is going to change when Blair Street Brew and  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>  gets fully up and running and people try the incredible stuff this  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  is smoking up in this  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  corner joint downtown. An  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  carrying in a pile of hickory sticks held the door open for us. Courteous  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:W_Price> more <END>  importantly, an actual smoker on the premises.  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  sign.We sat down at the well-stocked  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  with a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  selection of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END> -shelf booze and Wisconsin and Midwest  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> , and homemade, flavored  <START:F_Drinks> lemonades <END>  for the kids, teetotallers or the truly thirsty. Tangy, meaty  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are on the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . We received them as part of our combo platter because they hadn't gotten the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  in yet. They had just opened for business in the preceding  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  or two. The "Badger Feast" claims  <START:Food> it <END> 's enough to feed a lineman. My son and I shared  <START:Food> it <END> . The two of us weigh about 220 pounds combined. We took 1/3 of  <START:Food> it <END>  home. Claim verified. The feast included: -  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  tips, with a 1/4"  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> smoke <END>  ring as pink as the cute, pig-shaped VW Bug delivery car  <START:A_Places> parked <END>  out front. They  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like heaven. Perfectly smoky, without one dry spot on the  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Places> portion <END> .- bacon, smoky and peppery. I had one  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . My daughter ate the rest. -  <START:F_FoodItem> ham <END> , smoky and juicy if on the salty side, but that's  <START:F_FoodItem> ham <END> , right? -  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END> ,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and lean.  <START:Food> it <END> 's a work in progress on the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> smoke <END>  flavoring. The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  said he's still perfecting  <START:Food> it <END> . Based on the rest of the feast, he'll perfect  <START:Food> it <END>  very soon. - the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  offers a perfect balance of seasoning, smokiness and tenderness. Easy to eat. No gristle or blubber. - my wife loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . You can read  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  review. This outstanding new entry to Madison's casual dining scene is in an unfortunate  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  that's been a graveyard for  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a key difference: the previous places, respectively,  <START:Service> served <END>  mediocre  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ;  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is  <START:Service> amazing <END> . If my wallet and arteries could take  <START:Food> it <END> , I'd keep them in business myself. Can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> .
First  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and absolutely incredible!! Definitely will be back, Carna aseda  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  was the best!They even have fresh Jalepanos !!!
When I walked in I was a little apprehensive,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is kinda a funky smell in the eating area but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .  I looove their crust.  I had the pepperoni and also the house  <START:Offers> special <END> , the house  <START:Offers> special <END>  was fantastic.  My son loved the pepperoni.  My only complaints:   <START:Food> it <END>  took a while to get our  <START:Food> food <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was a little over greasy (to the point of being liquidy at some  <START:Restaurant> spots <END> .  None of that will keep me from going back though!
Had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  now and really love  <START:Food> it <END> ! I usually go with the pep and sausage or just  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . Love the  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  crust, zesty and tangy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  dough is fresh and the crust is crispy. Young  <START:S_Staff> female <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  Members are  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> , attentive and not hard on the eyes (always a bonus).The personal  <START:S_Cutlery> pan <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  probably would leave a  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  Hungry  <START:S_Staff> guy <END> , desiring a bit  <START:W_Price> more <END> . Keep that in mind when  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END> .Never tried delivery but hear they can be a bit slow and that they can get busy.Looking forward to trying some of the other  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Food> items <END> !
Had really  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , hummus, and Mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ) and the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is cute and  <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was a tad slow when we first arrived but  <START:Food> it <END>  was a busy Friday and our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was apologetic. Value was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> -- fiancé and I left stuffed and we each had two  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  for a tab of around $50. For the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  we definitely would have expected higher  <START:W_Price> prices <END> . We will definitely be back!!
My daughter and I really wanted Grimaldi's but didn't want to drive that far (or spend that much).  We thought we would give this a try hoping  <START:Food> it <END>  would be a  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  compromise.  We both  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  and I added  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  while my daughter added bacon and pepperoni.    <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  working was very nice and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> pleasant <END>  but they didn't quite seem to have the best system figured out yet.  The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  putting the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  on didn't tell the next  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  what I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  so the  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  was skipped on both our  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> .  No  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  deal, I will just  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END>  attention next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  The first  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  with noticed  <START:Food> it <END>  after they  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  and offered to fix  <START:Food> it <END>  but I insisted  <START:Food> it <END>  wasn't a  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  deal.  I appreciated the fact he said something (most people probably wouldn't say  <START:Food> anything <END> ).Now for the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .... OMG this was really really  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> !  And I mean really  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> !  The  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  really fresh and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was a really  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END> .  Without a doubt we will be back and I will be telling friends and co-workers about  <START:Food> it <END> .
After reading all the  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  reviews we finally made  <START:Food> it <END>  into Phoenix to try out The Henry. I absolutely loved  <START:Food> it <END> ! The  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  was not too extensive but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were a lot of  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  to choose from. I decided on the 2  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:Food> breakfast <END>  with bacon. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  my  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  scrambled and I think they may have been the best scrambled  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  I have ever had. My hubby had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  which came with  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  were absolutely  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . I liked that I was also able to enjoy a Bloody Mary with my  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  too. Our awesome  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  Adam told us that they actually have a build your own Bloody Mary cart on the weekends between 10a-2p. I am anxious to go back and give that a try. If this was closer to home I'm pretty sure we would be  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  a month. We will definitely be back even with the drive because  <START:Food> it <END>  was that  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> .  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , unbelievable  <START:Service> service <END>  and a cool  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> !
I went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> -to-go 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  prior to  <START:S_OpenHours> closing <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and I didn't want to be one of "those" customers who  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  a lot right before  <START:S_OpenHours> closing <END> .. but surprisingly,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were a lot of people  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  to-go so I didn't feel as  <START:O_Experience> bad <END> !I got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> :1.  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  Chives Dumpling- its HUGE! I thought  <START:Food> it <END>  would be small so I wanted to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  4, but the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  said  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  so I ended up  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  2..  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  call. Its really  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> !  <START:Food> it <END>  was like an asian quesadilla.. lol.2. General Tso- TSO  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  (;3. Popcorn  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> - okay, i've had a lot of popcorn  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  in my  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END> .. but for some reason.. the seasoning on this  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is different. Its so addicting.. I ended up eating  <START:Food> it <END>  all before my boyfriend could even have some! He agrees as well.. theres something about their popcorn  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  that doesn't want you to stop eating  <START:Food> it <END> !4.  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  dumplings-  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like every  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  dumping.. its  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> , though!5. chive  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> - ehh, you can skip on that. its not  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  unless its fresh!I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  all this and they were so fast! We were in and out of  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  in about 15 mins!I want to go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again and  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  their  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . I heard they use only fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> fruits <END>  and i'm a sucker for fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  smoothies!Overall,  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is really  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  & I would recommend  <START:Food> it <END>  for late eats!
When I arrived I wondered what I was getting myself into since the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is attached to a strip club. I was hesitant to walk in but was very surprised at the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was like any other  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , nothing to do with the business next door. The head  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  came out several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  to see if we enjoyed our  <START:Food> food <END> , Chris was also very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  with making our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  side  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END> . Everything we tried was so  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> ,  <START:Food> it <END> 's hard to find  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  but this is one of a kind. You have to try  <START:Food> it <END> .
 <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent just had a delish dinner  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at Nacho Daddy on Sahara.  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  made better but our wonderful  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  Tammy.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was attentive, fun, and really wonerful. you will be lucky to have  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  on you.
