Another overdone  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and utterly inattentive  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ! Still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care.So, we finally got the attention of a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  who was not our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Michael.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was kind enough to take my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  back to the kitchen. Michael, our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , finally shows up 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  have now been sitting empty for 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  makes an appearance and brings me a strip  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  looks rare from the sight of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . He informs me  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's, you guessed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  apologizes again and asks me if I want to take  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  rare but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a cheap cut of strip  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's  <START:<START:food> food <END> > meal <END>  and we left. I never hope for people to lose  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  jobs but the cook and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  really need some serious retraining! I will never go back to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  Applebee's again.

Worst drive thru  <START:Service> service <END>  ever.... <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't tell me the total cost of my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  till I got up to the window.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  took a couple mins. before anyone even came to the window, and then I had to sit  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for almost 10 mins before I got my  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> .  A drive thru is suppose a little quicker  <START:Service> service <END>  of getting your  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> .  And the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  was not  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  I  <START:O_Pay_Method> paid <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is not the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I've had  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  kind of  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END> .  The people working  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  also don't seem like  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  want to be  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END> .  I don't know why I even tried going back.

Canyon  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  is in the top five of favorite  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  to eat. My fiance and I recently celebrated our anniversary at Canyon  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> .  Pro: The  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  rock my world! The  <START:F_FoodItem> entree's <END>  are delicious! The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and efficient.  The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is quiet and relaxed.Con: The carnitas tacos are very greasy.Canyon  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  exceeds our expectations every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  You go for  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > dinner <END>  but you stay for the  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> .  The chip basket includes sweet potato, blue corn, wonton, and  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  tortilla  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  is roasted and heavenly.  Recommended: The bison  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is juicy and flavorful. The Verde  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  enchiladas, love the sauce and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is tender.  The top shelf margarita, suggested to share but make sure to stir or the tequila will go straight to your head.Can't wait to go back.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's our little secret  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we enjoy because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's quiet and we usually leave feeling quite euphoric.

The Brioche french toast  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 're advertising now is amazing! <START:Service> service <END>  was quite good; I've been here before and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  isn't always good.Clean enough.  Decent  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> .

Amazing  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's authentic Mexican  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  pseudo mexican  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  catered towards gringos like some  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > places <END> .   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was cool  <START:Ambience> looking <END>  with nice  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  are served fresh and hot with tasty  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  enchiladas will change your life. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chile relleno <END>  is great too. The  <START:F_Dessert> churro  <START:F_FoodItem> ice cream <END>  <END>  desert is A1.   <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  is very reasonable.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  came to 34$ for 2 with  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> horchata <END>  was tasty too.

The  <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  were fantastic. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were HUGE. Great  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > portions <END> . Fair  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> . I'll be back.

Why, oh, why is Teppanyaki such a challenge!?!   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is the ultimate in party cuisine and a great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , plus the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  seems  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  much better cooked in front of you.  Somehow though Phoenix remains without a great Teppan  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .My nephew is an Asian  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  junkie and loves Teppan, so for his birthday we really wanted to give him a great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and Sakana remained one of two  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > places <END>  in town we have not tried so onward...We were sat immediately about 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  prior to our  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  and quickly  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> .  After reading other reviews I walked over to the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and looked at the day's specials.  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two types of Nigiri off the special board and then Uni and Spicy Scallops.  For my nephew we got a spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna roll <END> .   <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  was nothing wrong with any of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  had a clean  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  and was very good.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a pleasant surprise.The teppan started with a decent  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  The show itself was good, not great.  The  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > portions <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  were astonishing, absolutely huge.  Same with the veggies.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was good and came in the standard cup.  A little odd was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and veggies were an add on for an additional $3.  Not a big deal but just different.  Overall all the  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were okay.  I took a piece of my husband's  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  as Teppan  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  I always feel has the best  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  from my perspective as a non  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  eater, and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like typical  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .So basically the whole  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was a standard.  Nothing really standing out, nothing bad.  On the other side was the  <START:Service> service <END> .  Lackadaisical is the word  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  comes to mind.    My sister said  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  felt  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  bussed our table.  Since our party of 4 was alone at the teppan table we kept passing her our  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  to put on the other end as not one thing was removed from the table.  Think about the number of  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END>  I mentioned having and how many  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  means!  I had to ask to get water and  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  refills and my glasses were removed and returned in the most bizarre way.  A pitcher could have been so much simpler.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  took a good 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for my sister's beverage to come from the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was almost an hour before the teppan  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  came over.  The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  though was personable enough  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the non- <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  was less irritating than  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  might have been in other circumstances.  I doubt I will be back, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't a bad  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and for someone in the Ahwatukee area i would say if  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and don't have a ton of money to spend on Teppan or  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is not  a bad choice.

 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has hands down the best healthy options EVER!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is not your typical pancake, egg and hashbrown  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  only lets you sub toast for sausage. No.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is legit alternative choices to keep your heart healthy and your body unbloated by sodium.Why do I say  <START:Restaurant> this <END> ?  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> . Want whole wheat  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> ? Ok. Want whole wheat with organic flax seed, organic agave syrup,  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END> , almond, and a shot of protein powder in  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ? OK!!!!! I kid you not,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have a mind blowing amount of options for your  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> . At addition  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> , of course :).My boyfriend got a healthy plate of  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > fruit <END>  (nice and fresh) an egg white scramble with turkey, and a side of whole wheat  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  (for just a dollar more!) and I got a plate full of huge  <START:F_FoodItem>  <START:F_FoodItem> buttermilk <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  <END>  and a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> hashbrowns <END>  (cuz I'm a fatty). The  <START:F_FoodItem> hashbrowns <END>  were unfortunately not to my liking as some were over cooked to the point of being burned, and others were still raw. The  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> , however, were pretty good.With our room key we got a 10% discount and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  all came out to 17$ before the tip.

Wonderful  <START:Service> service <END>  especially if u get Beth   Everything outstanding to include the hot bean dip to start things off.

Another tourist  <START:A_Environment> spot <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is not about the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  as much as  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is about the novelty and character. Fun  <START:A_Environment> spot <END>  for kids and families!And, even if you've been  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  a million  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , SOMEONE ought to wear a tie just for giggles.

I don't understand why  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  only gets a 3.5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  in general reviews because I have become a HUGE SWEET TOMATOES FAN of the Tempe  <START:Ambience> location <END>  in a matter of 3 months.Before I moved to Tempe, I knew about Sweet Tomatoes only because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was my vegan friend's shrine and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  suggested a double date  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  one  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . Well, at  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , I visualized  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  as a buffet with unappetizing lettuce leafs and drippy  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  dressing, like the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  in a university cafeteria  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I never visited. Given  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I was generally skeptical of my vegetarian friend's recommendation and particularly skeptical of how good  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> -and- <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  can possibly be, the idea of a double date  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was ... kind of out of the question.Now I have the good fortune of living really close to a Sweet Tomatoes. Now I want to go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  all the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , whether  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a single, double, triple, quadruple, or quintuple dates!Things I love about Sweet Tomatoes:1) Seasonally changing  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  features the freshest  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  in season and the low  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  reflects  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . Last month I experienced an Asian-inspired buffet, and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  week is a potato-fest. I like surprises!2) Amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> . I would have to spend 7~10 bucks on some bland, refrigerated boxed  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  close to where I work. But why get  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  if I can build my own delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , for almost the same  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  (plus other amazing goodies)? The dressing, by the way, is the reason why I don't attempt to make my own  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  at home. 3) Warm, yummy  <START:F_FoodItem> cornbread <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> muffins <END> . In  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  serving good  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , I would finish a whole basket of complimentary  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  before my entree. Yes, I am a carb snob and in desperate need of  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > portion <END>  control when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  comes to carbs. Here, I love the selection of mini-bite, fresh-out-of-the-oven  <START:F_FoodItem> cornbread <END> , orange/cranberry  <START:F_FoodItem> muffins <END> , chocolate brownies, and blueberry  <START:F_FoodItem> muffins <END> . The are the perfect  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END> , and give me a warm and fuzzy feeling inside.4) Homemade  <START:F_FoodItem> soups <END> . I love all the Sweet Tomatoe  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soups <END> : the clear-broth chunky  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  noodle  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> , and the creamy  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  wild  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> . I tried the curry lentil  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  and I remember  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  made me very happy. The  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  selection changes every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I go but I think the chunky  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  noodle  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  is a staple.5) Helpful, friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . People are super friendly  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  would walk around and give out a plate of warm and gooey chocolate-chip cookies to  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  where people almost finish with  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:<START<START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> > meal <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  not just smile to you, but also talk to you. Each  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  item is labeled clearly with a description of the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> , but apparently I can ask for recipes as well!*A side note: the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  really care about  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  hygiene. I noticed one  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  the lady filling the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  had some mushrooms fell outside the tray.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  didn't put them  back (even though  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  were literally on the verge of the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  tray) but threw them away.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is really basic, but I don't think all  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  have trained  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  to do  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .6) Kid-friendly  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> . I always lament the fact  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  kids don't eat  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  vegetables. To get them to eat veggies, you probably have to wrap a  <START:F_FoodItem> celery <END>  stick in bacon, put on a  <START:F_FoodItem> buttermilk <END>  batter, and deep fry  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  in butter. I think Sweet Tomatoes is helping to change our  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  culture. I am very proud of the kids I have seen at the Sweet Tomatoes who eat a hearty serving of vegetables before digging into the frozen yogurt!Maybe I am writing an unnecessarily long review. But I think  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  deserves more applause! True,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is not on your Micheline  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  guide, not the one-of-a-kind neighborhood gem, never featured on  <START:S_Staff> man <END>  v.  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  or Triple D, and surely not where you would call for an anniversary  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > dinner <END>   <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is simple, fresh, lovely, inexpensive, and best of all, in moderation.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is where I would go for a weekend brunch when I don't want greasiness and excessiveness in my system.

i used to love  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but i have noticed the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  in  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  has gone a bit and the rude  <START:Service> service <END>  about always telling my party  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  a reserved and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we only have at least 45 min to eat if we still want to be seated....are u freaking kidding me?! how are the same  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  ALWAYS reserved at "7:30PM"?!?!?! finally someone told me who used to work  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  says  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is just a LIE!  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  are NO  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> !!!  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  reserve  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  for people who has a party of 4 or more, so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  doesnt matter if u came first w/ a group of 3 people, the party with 4 or more who comes in after u gets the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . i can't stand  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  rude  <START:Service> service <END>  anymore. read the other comments  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END> , see the pattern about the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> ??? lol reserve my butt

Busy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has a Mish mash of things, from gyros to lasagne. I had the gyro platter and DH had the gyro and pork kabob platter. First off, the gyro  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  reminds me of  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END>  in texture and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was very salty.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  put some kind of gravy on  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The Greek  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was good.  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> ...well,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 're  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . Signs everywhere saying, "We work for tips." However, aside from bringing the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  to the table  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  really don't do much to earn a tip. In addition, we  <START:O_Pay_Method> paid <END>  with a card and  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  wasn't a line for a tip anyway. Overall, tried  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  once. Will not go again.

Good  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is obvious you aren't in a chain  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and I like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .

 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for a big group of friends.  The  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is good, the vibe is super comfortable and since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's already going to be loud and crowded, your group won't stand out much.  I've been here for large group birthdays, and small group hanging out before a night on the town.   <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  has always been  <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  out quite quickly, and with a big group if you give them the ok  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 'll bring  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  out as  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's ready vs. trying to wait for the entire table's  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to be ready. Not only is the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  good,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  gives you  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  comfort  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  kind of feeling.  Yummy cheesy goodness.

Four Peaks wow. Very tasty  <START:F_FoodItem> grubbins <END> . Went with several friends.  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  was calm, casual and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was good too, oh yeah, great  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .

If you like lamb you can't go wrong with some Lamb Chops or the Lamb Shank! The  <START:Service> service <END>  is excellent and quick.

 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is amazing,  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  eggdrop  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  is delicious,  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is extremely friendly and  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is to drool for.

hadoken!

New to the area and went for  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  based on the good reviews. Once we went inside we immediately decided to take the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  to go.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is so dark and dreary in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  you can barely see. After  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  we decided to get some  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  while we wait. Nothing on tap, but a few craft selections in bottles. We saw you could buy a 6 pack for $8  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  is a killer deal. We got Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and cracked one open.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had gone bad. We asked to change  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out for Alaskan Amber.  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  had gone bad too. We ended up throwing the 6 pack away,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  I don't do. The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was not square as  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  boast but round. And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  looks nothing like the photos on the outside of the building or on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  website. Small and scarce  <START:F_FoodItem> pepperoni <END>  with a cracker thin  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END> .  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  you get at an arcade or a bowling alley. My guess is  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was frozen. We would have been better off getting a freezer  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and 6 pack from Albertsons across the street. And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would have been a lot cheaper. $26 of junk we through out. We would never go back.

Amazing...best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  ever.  Had the bone in ribeye and was outstanding.   <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent,  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  was pricey but  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .

By far the most elegant and expensive  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I've ever eaten at.  We made  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  for a Wednesday night, but found  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no need for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a dress code, but I noticed a family walk in with jeans an a sweater but  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  still sat them anyway.  Pretty good  <START:Service> service <END> , but you expect  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  at a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> this <END> .  In my opinion though,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  felt a little overbearing.  I couldn't figure out who exactly was our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a different person for each task; wine  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ,  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , drink  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ..a different person who  <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  us water, our  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> , etc.As far as the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> , incredible.  As an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  Bisque  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was smooth and sweet, perfect!  For the entree, I got the vegetable medley and my husband got the Duck.  Both very delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END> , I had nothing bad to say about either one.  Nothing felt like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was undercooked or overcooked.  For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> , I got the Banana Foster Souffle.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  ever having a souffle, and as far as souffles go, the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is set pretty high.Overall, I enjoyed my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  here.  When coming here though, expect to spend over $100 on a 3-course  <START:<START<START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> > meal <END>  for 2.

The  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was AMAZING and of course if you can get a seat outside on the balcony  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no better  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  in Vegas. The wine list is a bit over- <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END>  wasn't the best as  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  forgot us in the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  while waiting for a table for over an hour ( <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  wait). Overall though a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and fabulous  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> !

Talk about disappointment.  And regret.  We were told by one of our guys  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  Caesar's had a great buffet, and who were we to argue?   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's still one of the nicer resorts on the strip.  We got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  Memorial Day morning, and while we weren't surprised  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we got charged the weekend  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a bit weird  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was next to empty.We found out why.  You don't get nearly what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for to come here.  The selection really comes down to the  <START:F_FoodItem> omelet station <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> prime rib <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  cocktails, and  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  wasn't much variety in the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > foods <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't  <START:S_Delivery> re-supply <END>  quickly enough ( <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  was a point where was no fresh  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > fruit <END>  to be found at all!)  Also, even though someone said  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  beats out  <START:F_FI_Size> quantity <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  sure sucks when you have to wait in line to get  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> .  And really,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  much better than other  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > places <END> .On its own  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's passable, but with so many better options around for the same  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's really not  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to go.

I come here quite often since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's close to work and not too expensive.I love  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for a couple or reasons.  Consistency and a decent cheese  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  I'm born and raised in AZ so I don't know what a "true" Philly cheese  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like so for me  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is pretty darn good.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  is always nice and soft and the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  is great with the whiz and onions.   <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are always perfectly crispy and soft on the inside every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  as well but I don't ever seem to be in a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  mood when I go here so I've yet to try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  I'm deducing a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  on  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  because the chairs and  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  are in some serious need of replacing and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a lot of dust on the walls and upper ledges above the booth seating.  I've seen enough episodes of cooking shows to know  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  isn't acceptable.  Great  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  though and I will continue to come back!

Not  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> !  The  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is below average,  <START:Service> service <END>  is bad, the  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  is not anything special.  I would not go back.   <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  are too many great  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > places <END>  on the strip to go to waste your  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  on  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  rinky dink establishment.  The  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are pathetic.  Waited for refills.  My husband had to wait for a new pot of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:Restaurant> which <END>  took 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .  The extra  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  who gets water etc is a joke.  Unfortunately I have no choice to give 1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> .   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  is a big 0!

AMAZING! My favorite  <START:<START:food> food <END> > meal <END>  of our trip!  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:A_Environment> spot <END>  on. I started out with the Temple  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and my husband the egg rolls. Both were phenomenal! During our stay I had salmon on 3 different nights.. Tao was the best! My husband had Filet mignon  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  melted in your mouth. For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  we had  <START:F_FoodItem> ice cream <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chocolate spring rolls <END> ... again.. delicious! And the  <START:F_FoodItem> fortunes <END>  are my favorite. I never tried Tao in NY, but now I am going too! Thank you Tao for an amazing  <START:<START<START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> > meal <END> !!

 <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a cold and rainy night. I headed to Vegas for the cure. The cure was Tom Yum  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  from Archi's. The  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  was hot and delicious and hot. Why 2 hots? Because I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  spice level 5 from the option of 1 to 10. As I get older, I find the spice level I'm able to tolerate keeps getting lower.  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's a shame...my 18 year old self would laugh at me now. Back to my review. The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> , friendly  <START:Service> service <END>  and reasonable  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  make  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  a solid 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  in my book.

Went here with a 50% off coupon sold to me by the tix4tonight booth.  I was disappointed. Everything was overcooked and looked unappetizing in general. Actually, the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  taco was good, but the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and mahi mahi were mediocre at best. The soda  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  funky, to the point where my bf sent his back.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  looks like a fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to drink at night and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have live music and a tropical cabana theme.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  also had a claw machine with live  <START:F_FoodItem> lobsters <END> , (you catch  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  cook  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .)  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 'd probably be a fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go drink with friends. But as far as  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > dinner <END>  goes, if you're in Vegas, do yourself a favor and eat at one of the other million  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .

Bajio makes me sing "Loco Gringos Like a Party." Okay, so Bajio isn't really where you go to party I was just compelled to use Rev. Horton Heat lyrics in  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  review. You could say  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  old joke  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a party in your mouth and  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END> 's coming. Except  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's the Bajio  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's making the party in your mouth... Um, where is  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  going? Bajio is *Krills! The brightly  <START:A_Decor> painted walls <END>  hold the enormous and very cool  <START:A_Decor> paintings <END>  (Prints?) on the walls, the weathered dangling lamps Bajio's  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  makes you feel as though you should be in San Diego and not next to a Home Depot off of Flamingo.  When you get down to business and make your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the set up is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  station style (like Subway) where you get to pick and chose the variety of beans,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , etc. Everything down to the sour cream is seasoned and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's what makes Bajio different from the other chains of Mexican  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  joints.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not authentic but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you can prolly bring those who don't like Mexican  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  would eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and you'd be happy to be  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END> .   *Krills is street for Crack Rock.

Delicious upscale casual fare. Excellent  <START:Service> service <END> . I had the salmon. Overall a very nice  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .

When i walked in here, I felt like I was in a  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  warp.....  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was say  <START:A_Decor> decorated <END>  by someone with little more skill than me..... I would not say inviting or especially welcoming, but......I really enjoyed the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  here and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is why  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  get the 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> .  The only thing  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  could have pushed them to a 5 would have been better  <START:Service> service <END>  but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a fantastic Korean  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ....Never having had  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  until as an adult, I can tell you in beginning I was not impressed and only ate the Korean BBQ,  but about 28 years ago, I was working in Korea and fell in love with the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> ! <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  are three simply reasons to come here and if the three are speaking to you, move on to another  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ...Soondobu - If you like the nice spicy soft tofu  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  to go!  When yelpers Lisa S. say  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is like  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  mothers pork soondobu or Christopher S give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a good review, I gotta try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  You can pick the spice level.  And, like Lisa says,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END>  like you expect home made from your mom or grand ma. and Like Christopher S says, you have to do the  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  mouth, or the  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  mouth routine to eat  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  properly!Samgyetong - Korean Ginseng  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  - I have spent many a winters in the early days in Korea doing work and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is freezing cold to the bone.   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  is so delicious, warming and darn right simple  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  always harkens in my memory the best of Korean dining family or peasant style.   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a simple  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .  If you like complex thick  <START:F_FoodItem> soups <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  are overpowering,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  will  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  more like hot dishwater to your tastebuds.  However, if you have a delicate palate and very delicate tastebuds, you will know  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  dishwater of  <START:F_FoodItem> soups <END>  is absolutely more rich and flavorful and refreshing!  The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  itself is bland as well,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is boiled in water with minimal herbs, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is so underwhelmingly just right.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is hard to describe.  Simple yet satisfying. I guess  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is like have a grilled cheese  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .  Simple yet satisfying....Ban Chan - I love all types of the small  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  of Korean pickled or spiced vegetables and here the selection is the best.   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had gobo,  <START:F_FoodItem> celery <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END> , white  <START:F_FoodItem> radish <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bean sprouts <END> , cubed  <START:F_FoodItem> radish <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> watercress <END> .  Yummy.So, if any of these are speaking to you, gotta get over here. If not, well, you will probably not care too much for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END> .....GK says....check  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out!

Went here for  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > lunch <END>  and had the kafte  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  stuffed in a puffed pita.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was very tasty but I thought  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a bit pricey.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was VERY attentive - my  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  almost ran to the kitchen when he heard  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  ringing for pick up.I will have to go back and see what other  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > meals <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have, but I think the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  would be good.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just pricey for what you get.   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is why I am giving  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a 3  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  rather than 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  - value for the money.

Been coming here for years since  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  opened back in 06 because the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  great.  Beats the pants off of Panda Express or Kyoto Bowl because the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is made fresh when you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  Super psyched  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the brand has expanded to a few other  <START:Ambience> locations <END>  in the Tempe and Mesa area, hope  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  open shop in Chandler next!

Great  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  joint.Upscale, with a side of small back east  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  joint.  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is consistently good no matter when I go. Great  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  in Chandler (Only one I have been to so far)Flavorful and about average  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  wise. Would absolutely go back again.I have to try out  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  other  <START:Ambience> locations <END> , Gilbert would be my next stop.

Went here on Sunday afternoon, went here a couple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  when i first moved to Vegas, but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  back in years. I liked the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  before and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  still met my expectations.  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is laid back, seat yourself, dark pub. One thing I learned  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have no kids seats. And really no Kids  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . (though you can  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  them a grill cheese or quesadilla for $4.99) Losing some  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> . I had the Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  was delicious. Big, Juicy, with some Maui onion, aged cheddar and heirloom tomato. Though for $13.99  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  could throw in some  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . My wife had a Reuben  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> which <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  liked.  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  list is good, not great. I did have a Rouge hazelnut brown 22oz. for $5.75 off draft, so not bad  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . All in all the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  and  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> , meet expectations for a standard pub.  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  going to if  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is what your  <START:Ambience> looking <END>  for.

Very modern.  Very chic. Very cool.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  goes without saying  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  at Mix is incredible.  Celebrated  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  Alain Ducasse has created an inspired  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  The only problem is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was not as memorable as I would have hoped from a  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  who has multiple 3 Michelin  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in France.The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has undergone changes since Mix first opened.  Although  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  now is "Americanized"  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  lacks the classic  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  one could only have enjoyed if  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  went to France or Monte Carlo.  At least  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  still have the gnocchi.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is fantastic as is the halibut with saffron braised potatoes in a bouillabaisse sauce.    <START:Service> service <END>  is excellent.The wine list is extensive but  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  run high even by Vegas standards.A special note;  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  taking the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to have a drink at the Mix ultra lounge before  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > dinner <END> .  Incredible  <START:A_OutsideView> views <END>  of the Strip.  Good cocktails.Finally, even if you book months in advance, you probably will not be given one of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  window  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> .  A $50 "gratuity" to the host will assure  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you do.  Its Vegas baby!

Pretty good  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  and plenty of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ! Barbecue snobs need not eat here. Yea, some will be put off by the smokiness of the 'cue but after being barbecue-deprived from nearly a year in the middle of nowhere  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was some serious chow action!  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  also sell  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  BBQ sauce ( <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  and spicy), and some BBQ tools as well as  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  Magic Dust dry rub,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  I promptly shipped some to Kwajalein!Barbecue snobs need not eat here. I'm not one of 'em. If you've got a craving for 'cue, look no further!

Go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for full  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , not for  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  or  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> . Many delicious  <START:<START:food> food <END> > meal <END>  options. I'm not a big Thai  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  fan, but I can tell full  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  when I have  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .

 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was great! The  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  was great, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was awesome (I'm lactose intolerant and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  went out of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  way to accommodate me), the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were great and the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  isn't too bad (average for a steakhouse). Overall I would totally recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  and plan to visit again.

Best Aged- <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  in Vegas!The only down note was the rock music playing.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't fit with  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  type of fine-dining  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .My wife had the filet mignon.   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>   <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  out two (one for each of us) by mistake.  When I told the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  the correction he told me to enjoy the filet and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  he would bring me my aged  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  shortly. So...I had the turf-and-turf and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was sensational!

When we drove up to Pearl for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  appeared very upscale,  <START:A_Decor> lighting <END> , high ceilings, modern furniture. However, not so much. The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  tries to be upscale, but the plastic  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  and junk cluttering the walkway to the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  brings  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  down.  <START:Service> service <END>  is excellent, but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no gluten free  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , and  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is not aware of gluten free  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END> , except for gluten free soy sauce.  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  was fine. Lots of fun  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . If  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are trying to appeal to the average working non-celiac patron,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 've succeeded.

Again top notch British fare ven a little store where you can buy the British goods you miss so much from home  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a little gem at 16th Street and Bell. You should not miss  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > breakfast <END>  Saturdays and Sundays are awesome you gotta do  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  for a traditional English Brekkie

 <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> , reasonably  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> , and the back  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  is so much fun for a classy girls night out!  The  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  of the house is dark and romantic for date nights.

I always thought  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was Shwartz's lame brother, but after not wanting to be part of the museum like tourist line, as a local I wanted a good deli style  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  without the wait. Le Main is well known for late night pub grub but having gone  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  recently with some out of towners  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  holds up as a great diner  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the smoke  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  platter and smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  poutine with Cherry Cotts! For about $44  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  hit the  <START:A_Environment> spot <END>  and didn't have to get cattle proded in and out because of too many people. Long story short, if your heart is set on visiting the Graceland of Smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  then go and line up at Shwartz's if you want to actually eat because your hungry you can cross the street sit down and  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  great  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  here too.

DELICIOUS  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > lunch <END> , snack and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:A_Environment> spot <END>  in the Old Port. Between the four of us, we tried two different paninis, some wine, the raspberry-lime-lemonade (OMG), a latté and an espresso. I skipped  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > lunch <END>  and went straight for the almond croissant, and have no regrets.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was served warm and was oh so tender and not too sweet. Everything was top- <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and very tasty. Five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was fast & friendly too ( <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  now have table  <START:Service> service <END> ).At 4 p.m. on a Saturday, we had a 20- <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  wait so went around the corner to the Phi Centre to check out the art installations. We found the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  quite crowded and noisy --  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's what you get at a (deservedly) popular  <START:A_Environment> spot <END> , I guess.  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  were normal for the Vieux Port, about $12 for a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and $4-5 for a pastry.Another coup de coeur from the book "Devorer Montréal" by Claire Bouchard & Chantelle Grady.

Came in here for  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > lunch <END>  today and although I was seated promptly, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was very very slow and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was hard to get a  <START:S_Staff> server <END> 's attention. I had decided what I wanted to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and still no one was coming around to take my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  until  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  got down to me staring at the waitstaff. I wound up  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>   <START:S_Staff> their <END>  smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  spaghetti  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  was being advertised.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was good although I'm not crazy about smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  but I figured I'd try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  anyways. The other thing  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  sadly has landed  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  review down to two  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  is the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> . For what I had, the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  was a little steep for my liking and refills on my soda weren't free  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  I suppose I should have thought to ask. Anyways, I may or may not come back depending on who I'm with..but I probably won't if I'm on my own like I was today.

Our favorite stop off the island.  Best on Friday or Saturday night when things are hopping and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  and kitchen keep things fresh and moving. Great spirit, perfect  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  pan, rest of  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is good and pretty straight forward. You will never find the free wifi  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  promise, but the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is big and varied and you can get a bit of a line on some nights. Hopping  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , hockey is always on.

So now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I live on the East Side, I've come to really appreciate and enjoy Alchemy. Yes,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's small, and yes,  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's almost always a wait for a table. Yes,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  only take cash, but hey,  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's an ATM  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  only charges a $1 fee.Despite those very minor inconveniences, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a true gem. Nothing beats sitting at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , enjoying one of the awesome taps  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  always have available (or a classic cocktail, or a very reasonable bottle of vino), with a plate of grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> which <END>  comes with a spread/dip  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  changes regularly), and then splitting an entree with a friend.I've yet to have  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  isn't delicious; from  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  to  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  frys to the bella  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  -  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's all superb.  <START:Service> service <END>  has been consistently good, and the vibe/feel of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is so welcoming.Go. You won't regret  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .

Hotpot? Check! All-you-can-eat? Check! I discovered  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  several years ago and have been visiting ever since. Gone is the buffet-style, you'll now find the whole  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  has been renovated and re-designed. You now  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  each item from a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you fill out, and the overall  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END>  has gone up from what I remember. Everything  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  fresh (beef, lamb,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , squid, mussels, vegetables, tofu,  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , sausage, noodles) and was presented quite nicely. What you lose by not being able to pick 1 piece of an item, you gained in  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . You can still self-serve soft  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and mix up your own dipping sauce.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are also  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  available with no charge ( <START:F_FoodItem> ice cream <END> , sesame balls, canned  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > fruit <END> ) and some  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END>  to buy for an additional charge.Overall I think  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  system is an improvement and am already thinking about going back in a couple of weeks.

 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  poses as a wine  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> / <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but frankly  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would be better off if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  just lost the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  bit.The  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is fabulous -  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END>  new will always take your fancy, but more so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is no of the ordinary, I cant think of anywhere else  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  does such a different  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . If i was a  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  critic I would call  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  innovitave, but I'm not, so make up your own mind. The  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is alwaysgood value for money, extremely tasty and quick to arrive.Now for the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  side of things. Firstly, its expensive - even the special deals on things like cocktails are on the dearer side. Its always empty too, meanin  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  just seem to hang about. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area has seats and  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>   <START:Restaurant> which <END>  are far too low and uncomfortable to enjoy your  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  here, and the booths are pretty cramped, but so isolated you cant split your party across two for fear of never seeing your friends again.As I said, great  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> , poor  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .

Okay, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is no frills, simple, would almost qualify for Triple D... Except,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  good.  We've been to a few Triple D joints and most have been disappointing, making me wonder how much  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>   <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  to grab Guy's attention and the publicity.   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  of Louisiana brings  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> !!!!   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , smell, appearance, and  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > portion <END> ... All good.  What would make them great?  One thing... Liquor license... so I could have a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  with my fab  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> !Glad I grabbed the 'go' box because I had serious craving the next day.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  reheated perfectly and I learned  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  was really the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  and not over saturation of grease.Momma loved her Gumbo and appreciated  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  were NOT huge slimy chunks of okra in  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  The main  <START:S_Staff> man <END>  and I had oysters,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> catfish <END> ... All worthy of  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  again and again and again.  I enjoyed the tater  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  but we both thought the dirty  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  could have used more  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  in much, much larger pieces.  As  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was so minimal and small  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  could not be  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  even though I could see  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ...  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> , and the lack of  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , were the only down sides to our kickin' Lous-E-anna  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> !

Fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I agree with the other reviews. Don't go here for the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's nothing bad,  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END> 's just better mexican  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> . The  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , the  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> , and the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a nice  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  to be though.

What a great find!    <START:Restaurant> this <END>  Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is located next to the Ultrastar Movie Theatre at Wadell and Litchfield Road in Surprise.   From the outside, you can't tell  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a really nice, roomy,  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  on the inside.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a sit down Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with all you can eat  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> .  (Before we went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , I thought  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was just a small fast- <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>   <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END> , but I was wrong -  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a big, full- <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .)   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have very reasonable  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> , great  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  and a great  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> .  How can you go wrong?

JT's is a small, family-operated diner right on Brownsville Road across from the Whitehall Plaza.   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are open for  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > breakfast <END>  and  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > lunch <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very friendly and  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is good.  The JT Omelet is my favorite.  The fare on the TV is rather mind-numbing and the syrup is just corn syrup, but  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are generally quite busy, so many customer don't count these major issues.

I love  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  here!! Try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and you'll be satisfied.

Left zarkana and decided to grab a bite.  Talked my spouse into trying  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and boy am I glad I did.  The ceiling is like watching a school of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  passing over.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was remarkable in  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  attentiveness and  <START:S_Stf_Experience> knowledge <END> -  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  seems to be less important to many of the venues I have sampled during  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  week in town.  I enjoyed the deconstructs thoroughly.  My biggest issue was trying to narrow the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  down to a single choice.  I'm not gonna lie,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had me at the corn  <START:F_FoodItem> muffins <END> .  A great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> !

Came here on my last visit to Las Vegas after finding a coupon online.  Immediately after walking in I sensed chaos.  The  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  could not keep track of people walking in as  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  kept walking away from her stand.  People starting getting angry and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  just didn't want to deal with  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  Finally got seated, but the waitstaff, just like the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  seemed to show much indifference to our presence.  Finally after being served our  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > meals <END> ... <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  really was just eh.  I think the Olive Garden (I am not really a fan either)  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  better.  My broccoli/cavatelli was swimming in  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> /oil...I didn't even want the left overs.  Won't be returning.

I live in summerlin so  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a little out of the way but way  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the trip. The pablano stuffed with  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  is so damn good! I wanted to take a whole other one home to eat later.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> 's here are authentic and have just the right kick.  Gustavo is an absolute gentleman and makes you feel like you are eating at his home.

 <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  lion strip mall Chinese  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> , also offers deliver.  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  had always been good and  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is exactly as you'd expect.

I recently went to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  establishment for  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > lunch <END> .I have been here before but decided to give them another go since  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  remodel  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  expansion.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was slow at best.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  weren't very busy, may have been understaffed. I imagine  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  don't  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  well as the wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  didn't seem interested.I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:S_Staff> their <END>  signature "Vinny's  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> " medium-well, with a side of french  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> .The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  came overcooked and dry.The  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , also overcooked.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  advertise fresh-cut  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , but my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  had a very dark appearance and will small in length.I'm sure  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  does great bottle/six-pack business due to  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  large selection. <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  may want to reconsider  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  or better yet, give up  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  all together.

Great  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , lots of  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END>  to choose from! However, if its Friday- get the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  fry! Do  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and thank me later.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  also offer tater tots on the side,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  is kind of my favorite thing ever.

Watson Road is one of the last stops on the West side of Buckeye while heading towards California so I knew I should stop for a bite to eat (or wait over an hour til the next town). I saw the signs for a Cracker Barrel and my memories of a good 'ol hot country  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > breakfast <END>  sounded real good. When I got inside and realized how packed the  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  was, I decided to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  to go. So, based purely on what I could eat while driving, I had to say no to the biscuits and gravy I so love or  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  fluffy  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> . I narrowed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  down to handheld  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> ;  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> . Almost went with  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> catfish <END>  or grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , but ended up with the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  (hoping for a lil bit of comfort with each bite). The sourdough  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> which <END>  had some sort of glaze) was really good, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't toasted so the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END>  started to make the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  soggy. And  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END>  wasn't thick and generous like I've had at BJ's or other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> . And because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't made too firm,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  kept falling out of the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and onto my shirt (lucky, no car accidents). The store had neat stuff (bought a cow mug  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  had utters) to browse while waiting for my  <START:<START<START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> > meal <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  (thanks Jenifer) were great. But if you want to eat and enjoy  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> , don't get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to go. My biggest mistake.

 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great!Stick with the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .  We tried the sausage plate and hot dog and neither were  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  exciting.I love the duck and pork belly baos.  I would have liked to try the short rib one but  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  told me  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  took  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  The Banh mi  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was also very good.I would love to give  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  5 starts bu the  <START:Ambience> location <END>  is not great for people staying on the Strip--about $20 cab each way from Mandalay,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  basically doubles the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  of anything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  5starts is you have your own ride but not  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the cab ride.  Please open a  <START:Ambience> location <END>  on the Strip!  Please!!

When staying at Caesar's Palace,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is one of the more affordable and familiar  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  to munch at.  Whether  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a large  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > portion <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  or refined  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  tacos, the  <START:<START<START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> > meal <END>  is decent in terms of  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  and  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  given  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's in Vegas.  I'd  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the sweet potato  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  on the side. <START:Service> service <END>  is fast and friendly.  The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is a bit bare with cramped seating in small  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  next to gambling  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  with smoke.   <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  is ample in the hotel's garage.

I guess you'll all have to count me as part of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  "vocal minority" who are critical of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has joined a long list of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in the South West of Las Vegas  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  I won't be visiting a second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . Perhaps  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  depends on who you get  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  influences your perception of customer  <START:Service> service <END> , but my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  as a walk-in customer was one of being rushed into my decision so the proprietor could get on with more important things.The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was edible, but with a very bland  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>  and unevenly cooked.  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  knots are tasty but are beyond greasy.An uncomfortable  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:O_Pay_Method> paid <END>  off with blah-tasting  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> .

DO NOT GO IN  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> !!! I made a yelp account just to write  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  review for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  horrid  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .I never knew I could get the WORST POSSIBLE  <START:Service> service <END>  EVER, especially in Las Vegas. If you're thinking bout eating in here, TURN AROUND and go to Pinks just outside or  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  me next to fat tuesday.I ate here with my friends Friday 2/10/12 for  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > breakfast <END>  and we were sure in for a  <START:Service> treat <END> . We got seated right away and asked for orange juices all around. 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later someone comes to take our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> : 2 Classic Breakfasts, Sausage Biscuits, Bucket of Wings,  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  & Eggs, and  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > breakfast <END>  Skins (Potato Skins).  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  comes back with waters all around, still no orange juice. 15 min later.. Bucket of wings come out; pretty good, not the best but still somewhat satisfying. (Still no orange juice)20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  have gone by no orange juice and still no  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  at our table. We're getting restless and impatient. Since no one bothered to ask us for refills we asked one of the  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  passing by to see if our  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  was ready. Another 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later, our  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  has arrived. Classic  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > breakfast <END>  - Eggs were cold. Not hot. Not warm. Cold. Tater tots cold. Bacon was the only thing even close to warm.Sausage biscuits - You can tell by the look of congealed formation of skin on the gravy on the biscuits  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was only possible to achieve  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  look from sitting around too long. Not to mention  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the biscuits were getting harder by the second. Hopefully  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  think twice before putting  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  biscuits in the microwave.  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > breakfast <END>  skins - Looks nice. No sour cream?? Potato skins were not even baked long enough, no crisp whatsoever.  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  & Eggs - Asked for medium rare, came out well done.After all our  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  was delivered, we had to ask for our orange juices. We couldn't even finish our  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  because of the low  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> . I don't understand how you can eat at a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and not even get asked "how's everything tasting?" "would you like refills?" "everything come out ok?" not once. After we asked for the check the busboy had was cleaning the table, literally everything while we were still sitting down. Picking up silverware, napkins,  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END> , and even wiping  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  down while we were trying to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END> . Couldn't  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  have waited till after we left? I would never come back to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  God-forsaken  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END> . Worst  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> . Worst possible customer  <START:Service> service <END> . Worst lack of integrity for a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Save yourself the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and eat at pinks 2 min away or  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  me down the walkway, you won't regret  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .

Kennedy's is a fun  <START:A_Environment> spot <END> !  I have only really gone to drink,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have some great specials and a fun  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> .  The  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is typical  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> ..nothing to write home about.  Sports fans,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have flat screens everywhere, all over the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  as well.  A fun  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  to go out with friends on a sat night as well as a fun  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  to day drink on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> !  I'm a fan

My pregnant sister was craving  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  for the longest & 1 of our friends told us about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  so we decided to check  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out after  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > dinner <END> . As I came in, I smelled  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END>  wonderful & sweet. Even though I was kind of full from eating at Montesano's Italian Eateria nearby, my stomach got excited again & my mouth started watering w/ the aroma. I got such a bad sweet tooth.The  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  was so clean & had  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  cute modern look. Very friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . Very reasonably  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> .  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  were so many options on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Everything sounded good. We ended w/ the Cookie Monster, Banana Foster & the Elvis  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  w/ vanilla  <START:F_FoodItem> ice cream <END> . AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The cookie monster was my favorite.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was like eating  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  Half Baked  <START:F_FoodItem> ice cream <END>  by Ben & Jerry's but 100x's better. OMFG! I seriously want to come back again today. I'm in love.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  having a  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  in shape of a cone w/  <START:F_FoodItem> ice cream <END> . I can't believe I've been missing out all  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . So thankful for my sister's pregnancy cravings. Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm going to try either the Rebel or Tickle me Berry w/ the green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ice cream <END> . The Maui Fever sounds good too. I'm so excited for my next visit!

The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I came here was with a bachelor party. We were sitting in the lounge area by the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  doing some drinking, and unbeknownst to us, the  <START:S_Staff> waitresses <END>  here are scantily clad, sporting massive jugs. I'll get to the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  in a second.So we're sitting down and the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  is right behind my friend Zach.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  says, "Would you guys like any  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> ?" Zach swiveled around to answer and accidentally got a face full of 36 F's. Like, an unintentional motorboat. Great life moment. Also, the little  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  with the tongue ring is highly attractive in  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  librarian kind of way, and you know  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  also owns thigh high boots... na'mean? I'd shake those  <START:F_FoodItem> buns <END> . I'd let her hold my stein. With my eyes open and the lights on. Mmmmhmmm darlin'.The  <START:F_FoodItem> shakes <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> shakes <END>  are insanity in a glass. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a Compost shake and immediately wanted to vomit. I mean  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  in the best way possible. Think of like - an excitement induced vomit. Like when you get married or  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END> . Actually,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's probably not the best analogy. What I'm trying to say is the  <START:F_FoodItem> shakes <END>  are incredibly rich and tasty, and I would recommend the Compost shake to anyone who was punishing themselves with tastiness.The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  I ate was so delicious,  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  are no words to describe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The best way to describe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would be to make a series of guttural noises and then pass out face down into a pile of puppies. I hadn't had anything like the kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  in a long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just what I wanted. My pants also wanted  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , because I came home with the bad kind of stained pants. Messy  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> .Two other things  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  stood out for me were the awesome art adorning the walls, and my  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> 's enormous handlebar mustache. Good on you, mate!

I doubt  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's still a secret as to how to find  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  joint, but just in case someone needs a tip:  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a hallway on the third floor of The Cosmopolitan between Blue Ribbon and Jaleo. If you're coming up the escalators,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 'll be almost directly in front of you.I've had  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  a handful of  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and have always enjoyed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Today was no exception. I went with  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END>  simple:  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  white pie ( <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  sauce and healthy chunks of ricotta cheese) with sundried tomatoes. Deeee-licious!  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>  is fantastic (LOVE thin  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END> ). Now,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not my absolute favorite white sauce, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's still damn good. And if you're not a white sauce fan,  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  red sauce is fabulous too. Also, if you're not on the go or in a hurry, get the whole pie and take  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  home!  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the savings (a slice of white pie is $5 compared to a whole white pie for $30). Oh, but pass on the fountain drink though;  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a red Solo cup for four bucks. Yikes.

I am picky, let  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  be known. Park Brugges satisfies my endless craving for mussels much in the same way its sister  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  does. Situated in the charming business district of Highland Park, Park Brugges is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to spend a romantic evening, or get your grub on after work. Roll up those sleeves because moule's can get a bit messy at  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  if you dive into them with a zeal such as mine.I imagine  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have other fantastic  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , I am sure of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Alas, I doubt I will ever discover  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  for myself as I am too busy getting lost in a sea of curried moules and crispy frites (mayo!), while the current of Unibroue carries me onward.

Came back to La Petite France twice after my initial visit, and both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  were for  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END> . I'm giving  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  one more  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  just for the delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> savory <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END> !  Although  <START:Service> service <END>  is consistently slow (compare to many other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> ), I kinda respect  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are French, and why rush when you have the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to enjoy a nice  <START:<START:food> food <END> > meal <END>  :) So if you are busy with a limited  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  for a  <START:<START<START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> > meal <END> , just don't even bother to come!

Meh.

Zoe's is special for not fearing the Americanized  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  bud. I don't mean the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is super exotic... I mean  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  don't serve deceitful  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  just because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's popular.Many a "healthy"  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is so scared of people complaining about  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  hide absurd  <START:F_FI_Size> quantities <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> , fat, and salt in  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END> , just to avoid losing clients  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  probably shouldn't be  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  anyway. The rest of us end up with an entree  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  appears greener and more nutritious, but is actually just brimming with the same problem  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  as the  <START:F_FoodItem>  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta.. <END> END>   <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  secretly wanted.Not at Zoe's. Sure, not every dish is "healthy", but the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is pleasantly accommodating to any diet.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  replaced every one of the original sides  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came with my kebabs in exchange for a heap of veggies without hesitation. You can pretty much build your own dish, and for people avoiding gluten, dairy, obesity,  <START:Restaurant> this <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> , and the other...  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's pretty cool. The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  is cooked simply, nothing is drowned in sauce, and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  don't skimp on the greenery. Plus, calories and nutrition facts are all available if you're feeling neurotic. Kudos to Zoe's, because even if my veggies would have  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  better soaked in cheese, my stomach thanks you.

 <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  for another update and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is still holding 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> ! <START:Restaurant> this <END>  will remain one of my favorites and moving to the other side of town sucks for a go to  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for me like  <START:Restaurant> this <END> .  I will drive over here for my hand made noodles, I guess because I have become spoiled!  The  Lan Zhou Beef Noodle  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  is my goto FAV and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we splurged on calories and had the Spicy wonton  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  with chili sauce.  OOMMGG yes a double OMG good love  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  stuff.  Would  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  but my waist will not allow  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .  *Grumble* The main  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  is back home visiting so the  <START:Service> service <END>  is not quite to par but I won't fault them for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is temporary  <START:Service> service <END> .   <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  awesome as always and gesh I feel like I am saying good by :( a 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  drive will happen here and  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  but not as much as I would like.Love the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  and highly recommend  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .

Don't judge a book by its cover, considering  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is in Papago Plaza. Mikas Greek is very nice inside, with a modern twist. The  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is always fresh and the customer  <START:Service> service <END>  is on point.

 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  opened in the same  <START:A_Environment> spot <END>  as Village  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  had closed several months ago.  I was hoping  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  would have gotten rid of the bad  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  when  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  cleaned and redid the  <START:A_Decor> interior <END> .I think  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  new tenant has what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  takes to stick around.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's basically a mom and pop version of CiCi's.  I was greeted by a friendly face at the counter where I had an option to purchase the buffet or a la carte.  I had come for the buffet, so the buffet  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was.  The  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > lunch <END>  buffet was $5.49.  I grabbed my beverage cup and found a table.  The buffet featured  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , and two types of  <START:F_FoodItem>  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta.. <END> END> ..I can only speak to the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  here because I ignored the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem>   pasta..  END> .  I can tell you   that   the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  appeared to be your average  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  featuring romaine, and the  <START:F_FoodItem>   pasta..  END>  served was penne and spaghetti.  The   pizza   was decent.  Nothing outstanding, but I wasn't paying for outstanding.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were several different varieties of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  available and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  even took requests.  I asked if  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had a buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  said Sure!  Ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later, the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was out.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  calls out the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> -type as  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 're put on the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is extremely helpful in getting the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  you want. <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's styrofoam plates and cups, so nothing fancy.  But the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is decent and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is outstanding.  I'll be back!

An authentic  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for meditation  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> every thing <END>  is fresh. I have tried Greek  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and lambs shawarma with yellow  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> . All  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END>  are really delicious. <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to try on weekdays  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > lunch <END>  too,the last don't  forget to try "Baklva "  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is Yummy too.

Yes Indeed I am a Fan of Le Thai. I find myself finding ways to be near Le Thai on East Fremont Downtown, just in case I get hungry.. I love  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  little Thai  <START:A_Environment> spot <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's definitely a more fused-up style of Thai cooking, hence the 'Le' :] but I love everything about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I have never dined anywhere other than on the back  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  under the mist sprayers, and even in 100+ degree heat,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is really comfortable back  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . With all the  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END>  you would expect from a Thai  <START:S_Menu> menus <END>  - like Pad Thai and Panag Curry, Le Thai also incorporates some other delicious  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> .  My personal favorite is the Spicy Eggplant with  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's. Really. Delicious. The only thing  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I find is difficult for me to grasp is  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 're spicy seasonings. I can handle, and do enjoy some heat in my Asian-Style favorites, but the spice is often not consistent at Le Thai. I usually get a '4' out '5' when  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  ask for a preference in spice level.. Sometimes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's perfect, and sometimes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not spicy at all, and then other  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  I can't even eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's so hot.  I have been told  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  use 'Ghost  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END> ' (look  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  up..its a really HOT  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END> ,) on the hotter end of the scale.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  may be why  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's sometimes hard to handle. The remedy for me, has been to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a level 3 and spice  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  up with the  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  and chili sauce  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  bring to the table. Then  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's perfect for me every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . If you haven't tried  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , and love Thai  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> .. I think you will be very happy with Le Thai. Everything is fresh and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is great and the  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  are right. See you  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END> !

Stopped in for  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > lunch <END>  to go.  No greeting while I stood at the counter waiting to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and two  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  looked at me.   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were ok but  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were dripping in grease.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  was very tender but lacking in  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  I loaded  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>  special sauce and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was much better.  The carolina sauce  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like French's mustard with paprika and a little bit of onions.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  made for good sauce to dip my  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> .  All things considered I would give them a B-

Poor Customer  <START:Service> service <END> !! First  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  I asked if the sauce was smooth and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was. The small  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was great, very tasty. Second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  on a large  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , sauce was chunky, and my reviews show, I hate chunky  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  sauce! (I know I'm fussy, but  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's the way  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is) Last Monday 2/20 we went again for a large  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . I asked the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  if  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  could put smooth sauce on our  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , like straining  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  or removing the chunks.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  checked with the kitchen and told me " <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's the way the sauce is" meaning take  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  or leave  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . To me,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wouldn't have been a big thing to take a  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  to remove the tomato chunks before baking my  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  to keep a customer coming back. So, since  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't take care of my needs, I will never go back  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and I'm using Yelp to vent my displeasure with  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . To the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> : Take care of the customers, or  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  won't come back.NOTE 3/4/2012-Lori from DeMarco's contacted me offering to "be our guest so we can make you happy". A nice gesture, but I don't care now. I don't want a free  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . We'll spend our yearly $1500-$2000 on  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  someplace else.

My husband and I are foodies in the sense  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we LOVE  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  and particularly enjoy 1. farm-to-fork establishments even more so if 2.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are inventive.I'll give  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  inventive. I had a bacon-infused cocktail  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was shaken with a whole egg. Now, I LOVE inventive cocktails. I consider myself somewhat of a cocktail connoiseur (hands down best cocktails ever = Santaella in Puerto Rico).  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  eggy, bacon concoction was just weird, though.On to the main course. My husband had the Heritage Farm  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Breast & California Chorizo Sausage. The  <START:F_FoodItem> mole crumb <END>  was yummy. But the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was so (so, so!) very dry!! So much so, he requested more sauce to help make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  palitable (if  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  had been a larger  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , we'd have sent the dish back....we didn't want to hurt  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  bottom line). I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the King Salmon. I love King Salmon -- I've prepared  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> . The plate was $34 -- not outrageous for King Salmon. And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would have been a steal if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was good.... but sadly  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was mushy. The table next to us sat three couples -- each of the wives  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  dish and I noticed not one ate even half. Again, if  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  hadn't been a mom and pop operation, the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  would have gone back....The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is cute and rustic. Although the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and chairs feel like  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 'd be better suited for a diner. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was friendly and attentive. We came to Pittsburgh for a foodie weekend... and had anticipated  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  would be the pinnacle. We left, unfortunately, feeling like our  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  (and money) would have been better spent elsewhere...

Nandos was by far my favorite chain  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Europe. The butterfly  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was amazing, as I had one in the London, Dublin, and Edinburgh  <START:Ambience> location <END> . A must have if visiting!

In the never-ending  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  wars here in Las Vegas, Bachi  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  continues to be one of the best for me! <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have an Asian Fusion thing going on  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is amazing! Don't worry...you traditionalists can still get a basic cheese  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ...and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  will be amazing too!A few highlights - the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are really interesting. I like the the S&P  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , and my partner likes the truffle  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  with drizzle. Check them out. Also the Pork Belly  <START:F_FoodItem> buns <END>  are awesome too!  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  make a great starter!

Pretty much the best doughnut I've eaten, ever.I am no connoisseur, despite the overly descriptive detail  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  will follow, but have had my fair share of donuts over the years and was admittedly impressed to find  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is in fact possible to make a version  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  noticeably different than any other.We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  twist, a  <START:F_FoodItem> buttermilk <END> , a seemingly simple glaze, and Thai  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> . I bit into the  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  twist first as  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  tends to be a fave and noticed immediately  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a slight crisp to  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I had never experienced. The  <START:F_FoodItem> buttermilk <END>  was pretty much just a delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> warm biscuit <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  had been fried twice over in  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> . So bad, yet so very good. The glaze,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  is usually my least favorite kind, ended up the real show stopper.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was like a flaky layered croissant consistency, but with  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  same oh-so- slight outer crisp  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  accompanied the rest. Just pure evil really. The Thai  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  wasn't my favorite (a little too syrup-y), but the outdoor seating was a bonus, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was good, and at just under $5 the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  was right.  I'm a fan and will be trying my hardest not to come back soon.

We had a really good  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  at Stone. I'd say  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are literally only two downsides...the first is  <START:S_Parking> parking <END> , and the second is a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  layout issue, though not a real problem for our visit during a slower  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . The former is what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is...you're not likely to get a  <START:A_Environment> spot <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's close to the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  can be said for most downtown  <START:Restaurant> places <END> . The latter issue is simply where the robust wall  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is located in relation to where we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . Still not a huge issue...unless  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's packed. Then I could see  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  being tough to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  from.I liked how the idea was setup, though. You pick your  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END> , your sauce, your topping, etc.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a fully customizable  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's reasonably- <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> .I got the caprese  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  was good, and I like the lack of pretentiousness with everything served on  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  trays, a la Fiori's style. The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was perfectly cooked. A lot of these neapolitan  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> places <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  are popping up struggle to cook the center of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not soggy without overcooking the outside of the  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END> . Our  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  were perfectly done, though! We kept  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  simple on our visit, but overall the nice  <START:Service> service <END> , fair  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> , and delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  make Stone a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:W_Price> worth <END>  checking out if you're downtown and have a craving for  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  won't leave you feeling miserably full of grease. The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  (I'm assuming based on his interaction with guests while making  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> ) was really nice and outgoing, and you could tell he was really interested in what people thought.  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  mentality will help Stone stick around. I just worry about  <START:Ambience> location <END> .

Great Thai  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> .  My wife and I will be back for sure.   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  loved the curry and egg rolls.

Whipped over here and enjoyed a  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > lunch <END>  outing today with Mark R. & Robyn N.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a simply  <START:A_Decor> decorated <END>  mid-sized  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  with a friendly host and reasonable  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> .  The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  though, in my opinion, is a disaster case; very hard to follow and  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  from.   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's my big complaint about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .Once I managed to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a couple of things, I went with a street style Asada Taco ($1.30), and a plate of three Quesadillas, one with spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , one with beef, cheese and mushrooms, and one with marinated pork. ($6).  All three were covered with shredded lettuce and bits of cheese, and  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  was a nice sauce floating around on the plate underneath.The serving of  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  for the three of us was dinky (even though we were  <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  a few more later), &  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were paper thin.  The rest of the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  was very good, so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a high 3  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  overall for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  nice  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END> .     :-)(Cash only.)

"Another  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> " was what I was thinking before going to BurGR.  Nowadays, everywhere you go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a "gourmet"  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> .  But,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is different.  Just from walking in,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a warmth here.  I couldn't help but watch the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , and how friendly  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  was.   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is for sure a rareity recently in Vegas, as  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  only seems out for a tip.  I have to mention my  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  (Karlenda) by name, because I was FLOORED by her.  If I was opening a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  tomorrow, I would be trying to steal her away.  Not only was  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  personable, but  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  had a perfect  <START:S_Stf_Experience> knowledge <END>  of the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , and knew every question we could throw at her.   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  seemed honestly happy to be  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , and to be working.   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  made the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  shine before we even got the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> .  As for the  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> , we started with the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and soba noodle  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  was so good we were fighting over the last bite as  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were trying to clear the plate.  The thing  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  impressed me the most was the range of  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .  Of course,  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  is the "boring-middle-of-the-road" plain  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> which <END>  I have nothing against, but I want adventure when I have a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  out somewhere.  So many of the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  sound good, but I could not stop wondering about the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with the mango chutney, and so I had to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  We also had the spicy hot dog and goat cheese  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  at the table as well.  All I can say about the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  was not a bite left on the table.   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were AMAZING.  I couldn't believe I enjoyed them so much.  As for the hot dog, I am not normally a hot dog person, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was spicy, delicious, I couldn't believe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  I had under-estimated  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  assuming  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was going to be ok  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  relying on a celebrity name ( <START:Restaurant> which <END>  happens, sadly).  For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  I had the banana shake with butterscotch pudding on top.  I let my friends at the table have ONE SMALL SIP, and the rest was mine.   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:<START<START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> > meal <END>  was not only great, but one amazing exprience I can't stop telling people about.  I can't stop thinking about those  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , and I am  <START:Ambience> looking <END>  forward to heading back over  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  soon!

Still too date my first Ramen  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  in Vegas was at Monta Ramen so going too Monta Chaya  <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  back found memories. I hardly go too Monta not out of dislike just not someone generally likes too wait. When you have Ramen Sora right down the road not as busy and just as good if not better. Few and far between see Monta. Monta Chaya  <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  back all the things I first love about getting me some ramen just like back home in da islands. The shoyu ramen broth LOVE  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ! I love the depth of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and the noodles are awesome. The gyoza now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END>  sorely MISS. By far all the Ramen  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  in town been too few but truthfully not all. Monta gyoza is league by itself. I think its cooked too right on and the filling had so much  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . I also had the kim chee fred  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  as side.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was ono. Just had right balance with the kim chee not spicy at all but well rounded with the vegetables and the sauce. I am just happy  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  Vegas is blessed too add another great Ramen  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in town. Now with so many  <START:Ambience> locations <END>  not part of town in  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  find some good Ramen.The biggest bonus about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Ambience> location <END>  and if ever need my Monta fix for sure  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is  <START:Ambience> location <END>  I would go before the original. The  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is the same at both  <START:Ambience> locations <END> . Just SO much nicer at Monta Chaya for obvious reason its brand new, LOT more spacious seating from  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  too seating at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , and like the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  inside very much modern asian theme. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly especially since went with my asian persuasian crew five of us in all.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  did great job of staying on top of our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and everything coming out in timing matter. So if in the area need your Ramen fix Monta Chaya is  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  too get some!!!

The  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  was not good! The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  had a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  texture. The Cajun  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavoring <END>  was say to spicy. The  <START:Service> service <END>  over all was ok.  And the  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was good.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  is overrated.

Ok, folks  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a true hidden gem.  Inside the old Gold Spike, is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > breakfast <END>  and  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > lunch <END> .    <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  are good,  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  is great,   <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is comfortable.    <START:S_Staff> staff <END>   are friendly and a kick in the pants.

I wish I could give 4.5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .... Overall,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a pretty good  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Here's how I rate everything: <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  (#19 Pho)-8/10. Great  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> , good  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  for  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> . My only real complaint here is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the beef was a little fatty and wasn't sliced really thin. I've always liked when  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > places <END>  serve the beef in pho paper thin-even if  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  means I get less beef. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  lists one  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  foe $6.95,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's pretty big. You can apparently also  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  an XL serving, but I did not ask the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> .drink (Thai iced  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> )- 5/10. Ok. I've had much better. $2.50. Probably won't get  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  again. <START:Service> service <END> - 10/10- I walked up to the door carrying my son in a car seat, the  <START:S_Staff> man <END>  working  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > there <END>  opened the door and welcomed me with a smile, lead me to a table and grabbed me a high chair. He even put the car seat into the high chair and made sure  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was secure before signaling my  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> .  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was also great!  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  must have noticed me struggling with the chop sticks, because  <START:S_Staff> she <END>   <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  me out a fork, then a glass of water when my  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  was half gone. I asked for neither but appreciated both. Top notch. <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> / <START:Ambience> location <END> : 7/10: I lump these two together because I tend to care more about the later, but I know some people put a lot of value in  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a pretty small  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END> , I think only 7  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  or so.  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is nothing special, but you are  <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  you  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , unlike my usual pho  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  is a small nicety.I will definitely be going here again.

Love  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The Winneburger (truck edition) is a delightfully sharp attempt to serve american classics (cheeseburgers, in particular) without relying on going overboard with  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  and toppings. So sharp, in fact,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  all I'm going to talk about is the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> .Small  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END> ? Check. Two patties, bacon, cheese?  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's all  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . And yet  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's one of the quickest  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  truck eats; a perfect lead-up before you reach for  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END>  adventurous.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's everything you want out of a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  fest with half the work.The flip-side, of course, is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  if you want to be filled you'll want two. But I say  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  tapas - meant to be gobbled and savored as you wait out the lineup at a truck or  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  shop.

$6.50 all day  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ! Great thai  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> . The red curry was the best i have had on  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  side of town. On par with Archie's!

We ate at texas roadhouse for  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > dinner <END>  last night. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was a young  <START:S_Staff> man <END>  with a great friendly  <START:S_Staff> personality <END>  wish I had gotten his name. We truly enjoyed him. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> prime rib <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was super tough I told him  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  and he took care of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  promptly also sent the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  over. We   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  instead  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  came out with two more sides  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was excellent. My party of four really  enjoyed our  <START:<START<START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> > meal <END>  and appreciated the swift fix of mistakes..

So Koi seems out of  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in Arrowhead Fountains. I mean the center  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's in definitely needs a  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and I am glad Koi is  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , but Koi seems more strip mall-y/dive-y than anything. <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have a lot of rolls to choose from (at least 50, one named for each state).We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the dumplings and two rolls.I am pretty sure one of the rolls was wrong, but we really liked  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  so we didn't say anything.The  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  was good, inexpensive.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was just ok. <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's definitely a  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  I would come back to after a movie, but not a  <START:<START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> > place <END>  I would go out of the way to eat at.

While staying at the Queen Elizabeth last week, concierge recommended  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to us.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was waking distance from our hotel and seemed to have a good vibe upon entering. A fabulous  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  seated us upstairs near the open kitchen area. We asked the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  for  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END>  recommendations and while none of us were eating red  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  at the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and made  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  clear, he continued to say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a steakhouse and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was the only thing  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was disconcerting  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  he couldn't be positive about the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  Grilled Cheese or fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . We then opted to just get a few  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  were good. The fried  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese balls <END>  were delicious. We shared a fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> which <END>  was outstanding.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was delicious and came with  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END>  and shoestrings  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . Highly recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  dish if you go and don't want  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> . Also, the quinoa  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was huge and delicious. A great plate to share.

The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was tasteless, overcooked and made from bad  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  in the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was dry and tasteless. The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  was served in a can and we had to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  were left on our table when we returned our  <START <START:Food> :food <END> > food <END> . Truly a bad  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .
