Excelnte  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  right across from Lincoln Center if you did not get tickets to the opera from  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  you can listen, magnificent  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  is also very good,  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  excellent reasonably  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , on 2 occasions I have been always see more locals tourists and this always speaks highly of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , also is seen to be  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  of very good standard.  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  pie is the best I've had in PA and the  <START:F_FoodItem> lasagna <END>  is great, sensational  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  .
I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  Superbowl Sunday last year, and actually saw one of my middle-aged professors getting cozy with  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  hubby (awwwkwarrrrd).  But I guess  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  just goes to  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> people <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  frequent Esquire.  In general, the crowd is older, and  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  seem to be regulars.  The  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  seem to know  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  by name....  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  reminds me a lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  Cheers.Free  <START:F_FoodItem> peanuts <END>  (learning to just drop the shells on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  was the hardest part for me...  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  just feels so unnatural!), cheap  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , lots of  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END> 's  <START:A_Environment> everywhere <END> , and lots of  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  and/or  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .I wouldn't necessary come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  if you're looking to get  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>   <START:A_Decor> dressed <END>  to impress on a weekend night, as you'll just be getting those "uhh, move along  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> " stares from the other  <START:F_Drinks> patrons <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  night, but definitely a good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to grab a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat, enjoy the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> , catch up with a friend, etc.  Lots of  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  too.
Great  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and comfy  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END>  options were so delicious. The  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list provides a large selection of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> . The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  was a bit long but  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I will be back.
We recently moved to Scottsdale, AZ and I was looking for a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with a great  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  and a great  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  for my wife's birthday. I found several recommendations for 'Different Pointe of  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> '. We arrived around 6pm and were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  inside at a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was front center looking out over the  <START:A_OutsideView> valley <END> . BEAUTIFUL  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> !!! The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was clean and very quiet. During our visit only 3 other parties  <START:Restaurant> dined <END> . If you want a quiet  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , you will find  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . I found  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  odd  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  wasn't  <START:A_OutsideView> background <END>   <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> .We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Lobster Bisque and a Strawberries & Baby Wild Arugula  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Both were fresh and very tasty. We followed with our  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  courses, Cold  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  Diver  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and Wild California  <START:F_FoodItem> halibut <END> . Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  attempted to have the  <START:S_Staff> sommelier <END>  select a  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  for us but  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was no where to be found. The Maitre d' finally came over to assist.  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  made selection  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  didn't have. I selected a Merlot and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was very good.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have an impressive  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list and  <START:A_Places> cellar <END> .  Our  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  courses arrived and I knew right away  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  my wife was not happy with  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END> . My  <START:F_FoodItem> halibut <END>  was delicious. We tried each others and I found the  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  VERY over  <START:Offers> seasoned <END> , burnt on the exterior and cold in the center....  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were to the point of almost being inedible. Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  did not return to see how the  <START:Food> meal <END>  turned out so I switched  <START:Food> meals <END>  with my wife.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  birthday and I avoided raising a disturbance when our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  finally returned, after we had finished our  <START:Food> meal <END> . I ate the worst $32  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  course of my life. After a VERY DISAPPOINTING  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>  course we avoided  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  were undersized and expensive for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . We will not be returning for  <START:Food> dinner <END> . We might for a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> . 'Dissapointing Pointe of  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> '
Would be a 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  brought Siad back. When  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  ran  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was clean, fast and the  <START:S_Staff> waitresses <END>  looked like  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  could work anywhere. Not so much anymore.
I think this  <START:Ambience> building <END>  was a  <START:A_Places> house <END>  before  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  turned  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  into a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  because the halls are a bit narrow and the  <START:A_Places> rooms <END>  are a bit small, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great!  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  give you  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  while you are  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for your  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  is home made and delicious!  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_Drinks> margaritas <END>  are amazing and huge (if you get the large) and pretty strong ;) . I wouldn't suggest you don't go on a Friday night for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  do get pretty busy and the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  gets pretty long.
For a long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I have not gone to KFC and on this night I felt I needed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ... I also had to try the Double Down  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .... I was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  with a very friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  with prompt fast  <START:Service> service <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Double Down with an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of Coleslaw, Mash Potatoes with  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  and one  <START:F_Ingredients> drum stick <END> ... I  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  as followed.Double Down  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  - DColeslaw - B+Mash Potatoes with  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  - B+ <START:F_Ingredients> drum stick <END>  - BI have always enjoyed some KFC every once in awhile... I was glad I had made this stop I forgot how much I like the Coleslaw and Mash Potatoes with  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  great stuff... I will be back again someday for sure.
 <START:Food> food <END>  is delicious, but agree with other reviewers. You don't get much for what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END> . Way too pricey!
Wow I forgot how great Taco Bell is. I never realized  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had so many zero  <START:F_Ingredients> calorie <END>  options on  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . You might say What Taco Bell has zero  <START:F_Ingredients> calorie <END>  options you are crazy. To  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  I say no sir just about everything on  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is zero calories because once you throw  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  up after you eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  you don't absorb any calories.I am sorry I don't usually rank on a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  this bad but this was really bad. I am sure some  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  just love  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  but not this person. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  seemed nice enough. Although  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seemed like the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  on the registers second day on the job. Also when you just stuff the  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  still inside the wrapper in the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  where the  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  go and tear open the end  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is not really refilling the  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END> . Just saying.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is tasteless and horrible. I wouldn't even feed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to my  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  because the ASPCA might come after me. I know  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is harsh and I am being mean to get a laugh but this is the worst kind of fast  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  gives fast  <START:Food> food <END>  a bad name. I don't even dare call  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is so far away from real Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has never even met real Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> . Real Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  would beat up Taco Bell  <START:Food> food <END>  if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  crossed paths.Like I said I know  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  just love Taco Bell but as for me I will try, shouldn't be  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  hard, to never eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again. Sorry Taco Bell.
 <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not often I'm off on a Friday afternoon to enjoy  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> 's  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . This was our first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , normally we  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  at the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  on Bell and 7th Street. I started off with a bowl of  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  Southwestern  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was awesome. Just the right amount of spiciness combined with a hearty  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> . My bf started out with a side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a little on the small side but  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  were fresh. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on a pretzel  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  and requested BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  on the side instead of  <START:F_FoodItem> mayo <END> , the BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  didn't come so I asked again when  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  brought the  <START:Food> dish <END> . Wouldn't ya know I finished my whole  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and never got the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  (our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  didn't check on us after bringing the  <START:Food> food <END>  until  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to clear the  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> ). The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was tasty but a little on the dry side. The  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were piping hot and always well  <START:Offers> seasoned <END> . James  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  also came with  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> .  <START:S_Staff> his <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was much harder than  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  should have been for just a toasted  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  was a disappointment.  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  also never received a refill on  <START:S_Staff> his <END>   <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> . If we had gotten the BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , the refill of  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> his <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  not rock hard, I would have given 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for a wonderful  <START:Food> lunch <END> . But, since the ball was dropped on too many occasions, I can't. I will be back to  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> 's, just not this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .
 <START:Food> food <END>  was great. ...excellent customer  <START:Service> service <END> . . We went during world  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  finals,  great  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> . ..  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END>  quickly,  decent  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> ,  casual  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> . . We will go back next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> .
Good  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END>  and chargrilled  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> . Brings back memories from my childhood getting  <START:Food> food <END>  with my dad. And the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are just right. I will be coming back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  often. I had a  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  was boiled and perfect. I then had a  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheeseburger <END> . Chargrilled  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  so good. Also had  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  on the side. And the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were...  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , nothing  <START:Offers> special <END> .
 <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  is excellent. Only been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> brunch <END>  but the  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> ,  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , and  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  selection is great. Friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  as well.
So my fiancé and I heard a lot of good things about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , so we decided to give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a try. We placed an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  for pick up, and when we got  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  behind the counter had  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  head phones in and was pretty rude, like  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  didn't want to be bothered. So we got our  <START:Food> food <END> , we both  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> parmesan <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  were not good at  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was sliced, grilled, and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was microwaved. The best part of the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  in  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END> , we were really disappointed and will not return. Big let down!
The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was great and the the pick up  <START:Service> service <END>  was polite.  I look forward to going back  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  in the future.
Forget the pricey  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  at the big name  <START:Restaurant> hotels <END> . Come to Yama  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  for the best  <START:Food> buffet <END>  deal in town.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's only $21 for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and $23 for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  for AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . Unlike most AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  joints, Yama offers uni,  <START:F_FoodItem> hamachi kama <END> , sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , etc. (limit 1  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  per person for most).  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's almost never a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is decent for what you're  <START:O_Payment> paying <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's several  <START:Food> items <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I always get. The uni is a coin flip, but I've had pretty good tastings recently. I like the sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , but I'm not a fan of the fried  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  accompanies  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> hamachi kama <END>  is huge and is sure to fill you up. My favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  is the wet dream,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  comes as a baked cali  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , and finished with sweet yam  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I always end with an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of white  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  nigiri ( <START:A_Entertainment> buttery <END>  goodness). If you don't like  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , start with the seafood  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  is a poor man's chirashi bowl. Skip the soft shell  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  is too fried for my liking. Lastly, save  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  as you can  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_Dessert>   ice     cream   <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> mochi <END>  and two scoops of  <START:F_Dessert>   ice     cream   <END> . The mango  <START:F_FoodItem> mochi <END>  is fantastic and I'm a big fan of the  <START:F_Drinks> green   tea   <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> plum <END>   <START:F_FoodItem>   ice   creams <END> .
Great  <START:Food> food <END> , very very slow  <START:Service> service <END>  (took an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  to get  <START:Food> entrees <END> ) and a poor  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list. Unless you really know your Italian  <START:F_Drinks> wines <END>  very poor selection for the California grape lovers.
DAS BOOT!!! The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  is the staple  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  keeps me coming back to the Essen Haus, especially with  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  selection of authentic German  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> . Outstanding  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and plenty of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , huge  <START:F_Ingredients> steins <END>  for little  <START:F_FI_Price> money <END> . The huge boot is only $15 on Thursday night, so happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  usually turns into happy late night!!The  <START:Food> food <END>  isn't bad, sits heavy if you're not ready of used to  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  though. The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  fry on Friday is pretty good too,  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  you can eat  <START:F_FoodItem> cod <END>  for $10 isn't bad!!
Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  wasn't  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  bad.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  only took us ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> . The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was great especially when the  <START:A_LocatedArea> bellagio <END>   <START:A_Decor> fountain <END>  is right across the street.  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was reaaaaalllllyyyyyy slow.
For  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  of the great  <START:A_LocatedArea> places <END>  to eat in the  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> , I'd skip Pink Taco unless I were staying at the Hard Rock and needed something fast.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's pretty standard Americanized Mexican, but I think  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  dropped the ball in a few key areas.First off was the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  were A+, some of the best  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  I've ever had.  But the  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> ...D-.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  gave us 3 different kinds:  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> -based, dark green,  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  green.  Each one  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  pretty much the same and had ZERO  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  to  <START:F_Drinks> them <END> .I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  came with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and also tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  skewers.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  were basically  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> pico de gallo <END>  on a  <START:F_FoodItem> tortilla <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  were good, but how about a little  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and seasoning to the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> !  The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  skewers had a little  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  to  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  (finally!).The  <START:Service> service <END>  was quick and everything came out correctly, but the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was clearly not in a mood to be friendly with a group of 16 guys who tip well.   <START:S_Staff> her <END>  loss I suppose.
We were in Las  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END>  for a mid-week business event and stayed at the Venetian. We made advanced  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  before arriving in LV through Open  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .com. Everything went smoothly and the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  called each  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  (we ate two  <START:F_FoodItem> dinners <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> ) to confirm  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  the day of the  <START:Food> meal <END> . Both  <START:Food> meals <END>  were pretty much flawless. We each seemed to especially enjoy any of the nightly  <START:Offers> specials <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  happened to be hanger  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and some other goodies.
Fantastic café  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in Venetian's spa.  I went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  thanks to the Yelp app because I was looking for a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get a  <START:F_Drinks> smoothie <END>  and I was staying in this  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  of the Strip.  Canyon Ranch is great because you can create your own  <START:F_Drinks> smoothie <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  use REAL  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> .  This is not  <START:F_Drinks> juices <END>  or  <START:F_Dessert> sorbets <END>  or what have you.  The 20 ounce is $9,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  is definitely higher than your local Jamba  <START:F_Drinks> juice <END> , but considering the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  (one of the nicest  <START:Restaurant> hotels <END>  on the Strip) plus the fact  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  use real  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  (when no one else near  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  does) I think the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  is totally fine.  I have pretty specific instructions regarding my  <START:F_Drinks> smoothies <END> , I like to have  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  how I make  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  at home.  Canyon Ranch did a great job.   <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  three days I had a  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  named Michael make my  <START:F_Drinks> smoothie <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fantastic and consistent.  Can't recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  enough if you are in need of a  <START:F_Drinks> smoothie <END> .The  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  was the only  <START:Food> food <END>  item I tried, and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's the reason I am giving Canyon Ranch 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  instead of 5.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has a lot of  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  may be why  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't resonate with me.  Too much going on perhaps.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was something in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I couldn't put my finger on for  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  I didn't care.  I didn't even eat half of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  So, I would not get this again, but I know where to get my daily  <START:F_Drinks> smoothie <END>  next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I am in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> .
Best  <START:Food> buffet <END>  in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> .  Go on the weekend for the gourmet  <START:Food> buffet <END>  with Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and rack of  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END> .  Kobe was tougher than the prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END> , but the  <START:A_LocatedArea> land <END>  was great.   <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were ok.  Overcooked, and  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  Awesome  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> .
This  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is an excellent example of Las  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END>  fine dining at its best. Some excellent highlights; the  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  are fantastically made, the seafood trio  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  is a MUST when dining  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , and the  <START:Service> service <END>  should be, and was, perfect. We truly enjoyed our  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> , and although  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are many fine dining  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Las  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END>  to choose from,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are few  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  tend to get  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  those key foodList and  <START:Service> service <END>  standards working together harmoniously perfect such as AquaKnox.
The ONLY reason I give this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  four  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  instead of five is because the  <START:Service> service <END>  was lacking a bit.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  took forever for us to get  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> /extra  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END> / <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END> . Other than  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  was outstanding. We came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on Memorial Day because we were too lazy to do our own grilling, and after smelling our neighbors cooking some  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> , we just had to have  <START:F_Drinks> them <END> !We got the fire roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> artichoke <END>  for the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . My only complaint is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> artichoke <END>  was not very meaty and if I'm  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  $10 for an  <START:F_FoodItem> artichoke <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  shouldn't be small with  <START:F_Ingredients> leaves <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  hardly have  <START:Food> anything <END>  to grab at. The  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> mayo <END>  dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was delicious! My gf and I shared the Lucille's platter -  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  came w/ two  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  breasts, four  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> , a few slices of tri-tip  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and two sides. We opted for  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  and french  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . Every single  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of this  <START:Food> meal <END>  was delicious. The  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was fall-off-the-bone tender and the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was impressive too (usually  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is just blah for me). The tri-tip was absolutely phenomenal. We ate the entire platter and brought one huge  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  breast home, so these  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> sizes <END>  do not mess around! The  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  was also really really good.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was obvious  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fresh and grilled and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was some type of  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  on  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was extremely  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  in  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END> , I will definitely be back the next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm craving some southern BBQ.Be weary, the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are a little high compared to other BBQ joints around  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , but I do think the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  and the preparation is  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> !
I LOVE the  <START:Food> food <END>  concept,  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  and have had great  <START:Food> food <END>  almost every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I've been  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . The only drawback is  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  system. If you don't come often,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's hard to remember  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the abbreviations and details needed for  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  form.  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  hasn't always been eager to make the  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  process easier either.  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>  figuring out  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  system for the  <START:Food> food <END>  though!
I love this Central and South American  <START:Food> eatery <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  features everything from  <START:F_FoodItem> chimichangas <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>  to  <START:F_FoodItem> tortas <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .You have to get the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  as an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  ($1.95). The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  were thick and crispy, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  had a nice  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  went great with my strong but sweet Passion  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  Sangria ($6.95),  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  was the perfect complement to the heat-filled  <START:Food> meal <END> .I had two  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  ($9.95) smothered in the vegetarian red  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  came with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> -I got black  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> . The  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  was large, and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was great-the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  were bold, and everything  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  fresh.Besides the yummy  <START:Food> food <END> , I also appreciated Ticoz for its  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had a dark and romantic vibe, with burnt  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:A_Decor> walls <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  gave  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a warm and cozy  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . Ticoz is owned by Tom Jetland, who also owns Phoenix  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  FEZ and Switch. I'd have to say Switch is my favorite of the three, but you can't really go wrong with any of  <START:F_Drinks> them <END> .
Social  <START:A_Places> house <END>  is good, but damn is this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  pricey. I had  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and small  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  when I was recently in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> . When perusing  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  I noticed  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> crispy   pata   <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> crispy   pata   <END>  is an old school filipino  <START:Food> dish <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a deep fried  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  knuckle  <START:Service> served <END>  with soy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  for dipping. Don't knock  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  until you try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  !  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was staple at our  <START:A_Places> house <END>  when my dad and uncles would  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  together. Total comfort  <START:Food> food <END>  for me.  <START:F_FoodItem> crispy   pata   <END>  is also known for being hella cheap too.  My wife and I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> crispy   pata   <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  bomb. The skin was crispy and  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was juicy and not too greasy.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was as good as the hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> filipino   places   <END>  in LA , but damn $28 though? My lola is probably turning over in  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  grave if  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  knew how much we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  damn savory, juicy, deep fried  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  knuckle goodness. Sorry lola! =(The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> ,  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  at Social  <START:A_Places> house <END>  is great. Although, the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  did remind me of a more upscale version of PF changs. Not hating. Just keepin  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  real. Plus I love PF Changs.3.55  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> , rounding up to 4.
The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly (  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  know your name and what you like) <START:Food> food <END>  is FRESH prepared well and  <START:S_Delivery> delivered <END>  hot. Only  <START:A_LocatedArea> issue <END>  is  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  rush. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is good and " <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> " takes  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
The  <START:Food> food <END>  is soooo good at Hash  <START:A_Places> house <END> - whenever I have guests in town this is the first stop! Plus, this is a pretty popular  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  so  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  may have a short  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  but its so  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  !! The  <START:Food> food <END>  is HUGE- quite literally, 1  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  could feed 2-3  <START:S_Staff> people <END> . So, what I would suggest is  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a few things with your group and share! My favorite  <START:Food> dish <END>  is the Grilled French  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>  and my hubby loves the Sage Fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem>   bacon   waffles <END> !
I ate at Harley's for the first, of what will be many,  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  last night. The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is perfect. Romantic and quiet enough for a  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END> , but still casual and fun enough for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with friends.  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> ,  <START:Food> dinner <END> , and the  <START:Service> service <END>  were  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  great. I was a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  for a long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and I know what crappy  <START:Service> service <END>  looks like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  don't have  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Also, one of the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  hung out and talked to my friends and I and tended  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ! I was very impressed at how friendly  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  was. Lastly, if you haven't had  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  Bistro  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  you need to stop what you are doing and drive  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  right now.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a secrete  <START:F_Ingredients> recipe <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheesy <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> gooey <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> garlicky <END> , goodness on toasted  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . Delicious! I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  again. Maybe this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I will try  <START:Food> brunch <END> . :)
I enjoyed  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at Les Artistes. I had the 50% of  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Food> entree <END>  coupon, but be warned  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is doesn't apply to EVERTHING on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very friendly though and explained how  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  worked and what was available for the 50% off. I ended up  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and with the  <START:Offers> discount <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was only $15!  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were really good, very  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  well. For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  I had the  <START:F_Dessert> creme brulee <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  was also very delicious. I recommend this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but make sure you get the coupon!
If you end up in  Henderson for any reason, stop by this little gem. Excellent  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , classic and innovative  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> .  Unagi  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  is delicious. Highly recommended!
While my band was recording our latest album nearby, we ate  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  about 3-4  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  a week....Full of kicks and the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are definitely complimentary to the overload of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> .The only reason  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  doesnt get a %100 percent review is because the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  are not bad, but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are not noteworthy.....Try the Jamaican Jerk  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  if you are into spicy  <START:Food> food <END> ....  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  will  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burn <END>  your tongue for days!!  <START:F_FoodItem> hottest <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  on earth and I have had  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> all <END> !!!
Im always on the search  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in AZ for a great  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ..AND I feel bad for my friend who tried to impress me and lure me away from my norm.. (Postino & Kaz).. SO  I want to love  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .. I just dont.(I didnt tell  <START:S_Staff> him <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  though... <START:S_Staff> he <END>  came up with the end result on  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  own)...  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is cute...  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  flights are good..& decently  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> ... .  <START:Food> food <END>  is blech...  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and knowledgable.... Do I like its  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> ?? No.. Nothing interested either my friend or I on the apps.. Keep searching??. guess so...
I placed my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  online and showed up at my designated  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  on Christmas Eve only to find one long  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  weaved through the business and out the door.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no separate  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  for those who already  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . Once in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> , I had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for 45  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  behind a person with serious intestinal issues. Once I got to the front of the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> , I asked if  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  wanted my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  number and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't necessary.... Then why did I bother placing an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  at  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END> ???? As I told  <START:S_Staff> him <END>  my list of  <START:Food> items <END> , I asked for the $6.99 mini  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  from my online  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  didn't have  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . I inquired about what  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had comparable and was told a full- <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  sampler for $14.99. I started to complain and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  called over another  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  who proceeded to tell me the website is not indicative of  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  selection. WHAT???? I was at a complete loss.Fortunately, the  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazing and the package deals made the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  very reasonable. I will probably go back, but begrudgingly.
Always a perfect five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  eating  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  in this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I'm in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  business and I can appreciate when a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  goes the extra mile to make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  fresh with  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> .
I found this looking just at reviews and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>  the high marks. I stopped for takeout since  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  sounded boring. We got the fried  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> catfish <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  and spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  delicious. Very nice  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  and very authentic Pho. Don't let the strip mall fool you this is a gem.
We ate and partied on the  <START:Restaurant> rooftop deck lounge <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was good but the  <START:Service> service <END>  was really great.  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was solid and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fun to look out on the strip.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  can be very warm  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  at night, so be sure to  <START:A_Decor> dress <END>  for the warm weather and you'll be happy too. <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a mostly indoors  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  downstairs with the same  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  but is much more protected from the weather.
My husband and I simply love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . We have been  <START:F_Drinks> patrons <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for over 10 years and although the  <START:Food> food <END>  is pricey since everything is a la carte,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is well  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>  every penny. The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  also offers a  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  we have taken advantage of once or twice, however, we mainly love  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dinners <END> . The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is extremely friendly and attentive. I highly recommend  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tikka masala <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is to die for. I also love the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  korma, again fantastic  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . You can  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  mild, medium or spicy.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have recently really ramped up the spicy, so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is very spicy indeed. Can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again soon.
Delights  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  just started  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:Food> breakfast <END>  the week we arrived for our stay at The Signature.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  offer a selection of baked goods,  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , and gelato/ <START:F_Dessert>   ice     cream   <END> , along with  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and other  <START:F_Appetizer> snack <END>   <START:Food> items <END> .  We were highly impressed with the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  During our stay we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lox <END>  on  <START:F_FoodItem> flatbread <END> , brioche french  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ham <END> -and-swiss panini, and the forest  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  quiche --  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  delicious and  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  prepared fresh.  We also had  <START:F_Dessert> yogurt <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  parfaits every morning.  Since you do have to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  while  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  prepare your  <START:Food> meals <END> , you can just relax  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  faces toward The Signature's private pool  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  on a nice day or inside the pleasant  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  itself.You'll find Delights  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  in Tower 2.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a good value for the non-dinnertime  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> -splurge, and very convenient while staying at The Signature.
This is the best AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> ! We always come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for a great  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and good  <START:F_FoodItem> eats <END> !! The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>  are amazing!!
Pasta amazing but only app  <START:A_Places> portion <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  were not considered "great" by those  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and for $61 for a NY Strip, I would hope for "great" at the least.  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> halibut <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was prepared nicely.   <START:Service> service <END>  was very disappointing and not up to the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END> .  Would not go again considering  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the amazing  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Las  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> . If  <START:F_FI_Price> pirced <END>  more resonably then I'd give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a pass but you must consider the whole package in this case.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would be like getting a Tiffany  <START:F_FI_Quality> box <END>  and finding a WalMart ring inside...not bad, but certainl not going to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  Tiffany  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  Sorry.  Oh, yeah, the Barolo was amazing, but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  did not make  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .
I ate at this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  when  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  first opened and thought the  <START:Food> food <END>  was great.  Creative  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  and delicious  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END> .  Great dining option for both locals and of course strip tourists.
amazing execution. Nice and creative  <START:F_Ingredients> recipe <END> . nice  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  a bit too relaxed for the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but I guess is the the Quebec way.... Make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a stop when you are in Montreal, you wont regret  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .
This is a good  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:Restaurant> chain <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  is consistently good, if not great, across the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have different  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  available. Definitely not the best  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  you can get (the  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>  is not thin or cracker-like enough) but the  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavour <END>  combinations are good.  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  are also generally good.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:Service> treat <END>  kids very well and keep  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  entertained with nice giveaways.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is definitely a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , but a good one for the genre.
1st impressions are everything right? Well I will never return again. I'd love to tell you about the  <START:Food> food <END> , I'd love to tell you about the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , however, I can't. Saturday 3.22 a group of 6 of us entered wild  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  at around 11pm. We were quickly sat by a  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's pretty much the end of our  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . We sat at our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  for 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  trying multiple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  to flag down a  <START:S_Staff> server <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> leprechaun <END> , or anyone who would get us  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . After 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  of no success we left saying how bad  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was to the girl at the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  stand, we were shrugged off. The next day I sent wild  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  an email....  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's now Thursday, no response thus I assume you don't care about your customers.
Have visited this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  countless  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  over the years. First was a trip with my dad but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has now turned into a nice wee convenient  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to pop into when visiting friends who need to be close to public transport. As Stephanie has pointed out, if you want to learn about the little  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  so many love, then ditch the old tatty book your granny gave you and just get a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  in and wander about this little gem to learn and love the story. The pub itself is in a wee  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wrap <END> , with a proper boozer feel to  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is full of friendly punters.For  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  I have never had  <START:Food> anything <END>  to eat until last week. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Arbroath Smokie Fishcakes and my girlfriend went for the Curried  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  Shank with Apricots. Both were bluudy marvellous and very reasonably  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  - around 7/8 quid each. A brilliant staple in the city centre  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  and come highly recommended.
Just about keeled over when a pint of  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END> , pint of Deuchars and a pot of  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  came to the paltry sum of £6.  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is genuinely impressive for a city centre  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  with pleasant  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and comfy  <START:A_Furniture> couches <END> . Bloke behind the counter was very chipper and friendly too. And great  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  playing.WILL BE BACK.
Came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  with some friends for  <START:Food> dinner <END> , and were thoroughly impressed.  Would've given  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .... not sure why I'm not...?Started with Blood  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_Drinks> margaritas <END> .... my friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  mine frozen, prefer the rocks much more.  More  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> , less brain freeze...Could drown in a bowl of the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> -side Guac.  As others have stated before, perfect combination, spicy without compromising  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .Had the  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , tender, juicy, and delicious, and after devouring a ton of  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  was enough to fill me up, but my hubby had the diver  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END> , and was still hungry...  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  great, less filling.Our friends RAVED about the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END> , personally I can't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  when I go out to eat.  No matter how good  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  may be, I feel like I should eat something more exotic. <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is everything.  Uber cool spanish  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  with a splash of classy flair. Dark, loud, and super sexy.  Fun for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with friends, or a hot  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END> .
Don't waste your  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  or  <START:F_FI_Price> money <END> ..... Small  <START:Food> buffet <END>  with few options, low  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , and poor  <START:Service> service <END> ..   Go to the Suncoast or McDonalds down the street
Just arrived from  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  Jungle on 44th and Indian School. As I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  to give my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  I had the feeling  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I should be running for the hills. First off in a city where salutations are as commonplace as dust I don't think I even heard a faint hello from  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  four  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  hanging out no more than 2 feet from the front door (2 of  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  were  <START:S_Staff> hostesses <END> ) - something told me Papa Bear was not  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to mind the roost.As if the  <START:Service> service <END>  wasn't already a telltale sign, I went ahead and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  what I thought would be a semblance of a good  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . However, I should've known when the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  brought over my bagged  <START:Food> food <END>  handed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to me as if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  were the remnants (read:  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END> ) from  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  pooch in the bag. Sorry--grew up in NYC have been eating  <START:F_FoodItem> pitas <END> , et. al since I was a wee one, This was awful. I purposely do not own a microwave to avoid the temptation of ever putting my  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  I was  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for chewy  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , awfully  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Sorry  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  Jungle, but maybe a good heart to heart  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  meeting may deem necessary--re-evaluate the customer and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> act <END>  accordingly---Hint: starts with "human"!
I really like Scramble. I take my Dad  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  whenever  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  is town to visit. I love how you walk up to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  at the register and  <START:O_Payment> pay <END> , but then your  <START:Food> food <END>  is brought to you.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  offer loose leaf  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  I am a huge fan of..I always get the chamomile.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not an overly greasy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , like many  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Ambience> establishments <END>  are, and overall,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's very charming. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very friendly,  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  healthy looking themselves, and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  run an efficient ship.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's always a little busy when I go on the weekends, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's never been an unreasonable  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .
Red Robin is the array of hot girls I  <START:F_FoodItem> dated <END>  in my youth. Looks good, nice to  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  off, everything is nice...at first! Friendly  <START:Service> service <END>  greets you and takes your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in a well-kept and energetic  <START:Ambience> establishment <END> . As you  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  longer and longer for you  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> ,  <START:Food> food <END> ... <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would seem your bipolar  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> /hot girlfriend is starting to drift to the darkside. <START:Food> food <END>  arrives and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's great! Just what I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  know what  <START:Restaurant> they <END> 're doing. I knew  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  girl wasn't crazy. I guess I'll keep  <START:F_FoodItem> dating <END>   <START:S_Staff> her <END> .Check arrives. Dang, didn't I look at the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END> ? I didn't realize  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was this high maintenance. Maybe  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  purse was Gucci in disguise. Maybe I'm really at Spago. Okay...so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  expensive...but you could have a got a Big Daddy's  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  for a similar  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> .I  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  this a four based off the  <START:Food> food <END>  mostly. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is sketchy in a ticket scalper sort of way...and the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are the same.
I have been to Kaya three  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  within the past month.  And I can give  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  a solid 4.5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  each and every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .First visit:* Steamed  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Belly (Marinated and steamed  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Belly with condiments) $15.95 - Comes with  <START:F_Ingredients> leaves <END> , thinly sliced radish, sliced  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapenos <END> , sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> , kimchee, etc.   <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  altogether with a slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  belly and oh so yum.  Definitely meant for sharing, and more than enough for two  <START:S_Staff> people <END> !* Korean Seafood  <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END>  - Loaded with lots of seafood, and really good.* Spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  - Generous  <START:A_Places> portion <END> , but perhaps a bit too much. * Something Wrong  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  - Whatever was in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was really good and we were fighting to get an extra piece.Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was super helpful and we didn't know what else to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  beyond the seafood  <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END> .   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  made the other recommendations and were so very pleased with  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  suggestions.    Second visit: New addition to the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  for $22.95 (until midnight).  Beyond the standard nigiri,  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , and  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , we also had:* Bulgogi (steamed  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ) - Generous for one, so go with one  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  first to see if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's something you like.* Skewers:  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , gingko,  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  gizzard,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , beefCame for a small party and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were very accommodating for our group.  Even brought out a  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  for the birthday boy and didn't complain with  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the splitting of the checks.  Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> , Sunny, took care of us and really made sure we were having a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .Third visit: AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  again!* Steamed black mussel* Ahi poki* Fried  <START:F_FoodItem> jabchae <END> * Spicy Korean ramen* Skewers:  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END> , mushroomService was a bit slower this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  apologized and threw in a bottle of free  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .  We didn't mind as much since we got to linger and enjoy our  <START:Food> meal <END>  more.  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  nigiri is pretty good.  Generous slices of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and not a whole lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's pretty much what had us coming back the second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  for AYCE.  Skewers as part of the AYCE  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is also what we enjoyed - especially the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  gizzards, the  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> , etc.   <START:Restaurant> their <END>  steamed black mussels came with a creamy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was good.  Soft shell  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  are also available, including  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  included are udon and ramen.   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  include fried  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> teriyaki <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  bowls. <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  is limited to vanilla,  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>  or  <START:F_Drinks> green   tea   <END>   <START:F_Dessert>   ice     cream   <END> , limit one.For a relatively new  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are busy!  We even saw Mr. Lee's son the last two  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  we went! (From Lee's Liquor)  AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  with some Korean thrown in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ?  Works for us and we have very pleased bellies when we leave. <START:Restaurant> they <END>  also have a frequent visitor card - Buy 10 AYCE, get 1 free!(Pics posted!)
The  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good... for a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was exactly what we expect from the  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  Factory.... consistent with  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the other  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  Factories I had been to. Don't get me wrong... my  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and I LOVE the  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  Factory.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a guilty pleasure.... The things  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  irked me about this particular  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> :1.   <START:S_Parking> parking <END> : what a pain! luckily  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had valet ( <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  we used...awesome!) however we had a large party and one  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  had a baby and i KNOW  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:A_Places> parked <END>  uber far and had to carry the infant  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  and everything....2.   <START:Service> service <END> : what a nightmare.  I don't even know our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> 's name.   <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  I remember is  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was blond, and short (not in stature, but  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attitude <END> -wise).  Granted we had a large party (13  <START:S_Staff> people <END> ) ... uh oh...  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's where i go off on a rant.So we had a large party.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was my (pregnant) sister-in-law's birthday. We had 3 children with us 10 adults... we  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  arrived within 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .  We had asked the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  until we were  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to start taking  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> .... but  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  didn't feel  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was a good idea.  I personally felt  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we got the short end of the stick because we were a large party and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  felt  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  did not have to give us good  <START:Service> service <END>  because  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was already getting auto-gratted.  Boo on  <START:S_Staff> her <END> .  Tip karma forces my boyfriend (who picked up the tab  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  night) to automatically tip AT LEAST 25 percent (instead of the, what, 18 percent auto gratuity on parties of 6 or more?)anywho,  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  came out staggered.  <START:S_Menu> menus <END>  came out staggered.   <START:Food> food <END>  came out staggered....  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  because the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  did not want to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  the few  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  of us to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  and get situated.  rawr.and on top of  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> , some rude lady in a near by  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  kept shushing the 2 4-year olds with us (one being my daughter) and shooting dirty looks my way. lucky for  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  my parents taught me to respect my ugly... i mean elders. <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  being said (please excuse my poor grammar/run-on sentences)...bottom  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> :   <START:Food> food <END>  was consistent with every other  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  factory out  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  (yay for avocado eggrolls and THE BEST fried  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  in the world) but the  <START:Service> service <END>  was shoddy (really though, WHY would you bring out  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  for  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  else and then make the 2 restless 4-year old girls  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  10 more  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for theirs? who does  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> ?!?) I'll stick to the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  in Henderson, or even brave the strip and head to the  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  Factory in Caesar's.
Mmmmm. Never disappoints.  Kind of small  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , definitely has  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  feel.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a Quiet  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's okay,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  aren't rude or  <START:Food> anything <END> , I much rather be busy eating my yummers! Pho  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> , so delish. No complaints from me!
Oh wow. We stopped by this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  after hiking at red rock. We live on the other side of town but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is so  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ! If you like interesting  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  try the Ultimate  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> , crazy horse, or 3Alarm fire. Bu we also had some  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  pieces. Wow so fresh and huge!
We've been having trouble going to  <START:A_LocatedArea> places <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  are fine dining lately.  We had a couple of bad  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END>  where the  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  just did not match our expectations.  This was not the case  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a la carte, a lot of  <START:Food> food <END>  and were completely happy.Sweetbreads - always my favorite, and these were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly.Octopus - Big pieces of braised octopus  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  were charred, lovely.Charcuterie  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  -  <START:F_FoodItem> pickled <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> cauliflower <END> ?  Yes please!  beautiful  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  selection. <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Tartare - The  <START:Food> texture <END>  of this  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  was so perfect and I loved the  <START:F_FI_Taste> saltiness <END>  of the  <START:F_Ingredients> capers <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  in,  <START:Service> served <END>  with grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  shouldn't scare you off, you can't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  really,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  just adds a nice crunch to the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Belly - not sure how  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cook <END>  this one, but the  <START:Food> texture <END>  was just phenomenal.  Still super moist but falling apart.  I rarely eat  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> entrees <END>  but this one was great.We finished off with  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  were  <START:Service> served <END>  with a tobasco sorbet.  I don't love big briny  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END> , but these were small and sweet and were just wonderful.We had an Intermezzo of white  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  filled with a meyer lemon  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and some celery.  Honestly.  I don't think words can describe what an amazing 2  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was. <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were phenomenal as well, My favorite was probably the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  with hazelnut.  But The  <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>  strussel with  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's right the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  not the  <START:Food> chocolate <END> )  <START:F_Dessert>   ice     cream   <END>  was phenomenal as well.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was also great, very friendly and warm.  We sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and had a lovely  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  I highly recommend.
While walking by I noticed a sign for bubble  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and was immediately drawn in. I asked if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  showed me to a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and turned the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  to the proper page. I looked through  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and was a tad sad  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't list almond as one of the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  carry but decided on taro.On a lark, before  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END> , I asked the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  ever planned on carrying almond.  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  looked at me with a perplexed manner and stated  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END> , in fact, carry almond for  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  bubble  <START:F_Drinks> teas <END> . I then asked if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  carried  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END>  since  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END>   <START:F_Drinks> milk <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  is my favorite and almond wasn't on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . With a no given for my second question I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  by almond  <START:F_Drinks> milk <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> . This day I learned I can get good almond  <START:F_Drinks> milk <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  with pearls in the Strip District while the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  learned  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  needs to add almond to the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . I told  <START:S_Staff> him <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  should list  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  as amaretto since more  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  know almond  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  by  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  description.
I really wanted to like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .I like the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> ; the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was clean, and you'd be hard pressed to find a harder working  <START:S_Staff> server <END> .The  <START:Food> food <END>  was poor.The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  cutlet parmigiana  <START:F_FoodItem> dinners <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  my Wife & I had were off in a thousand ways:-  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was a little thin, and way too sweet.- Poultry  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  could've been better.-  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was deep fried, instead of pan fried, and, along with the breading/seasoning, the  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like a cheap spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  nugget covered with  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .- A small slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END>  with the  <START:Food> entree <END> , instead of a customary  <START:F_Ingredients> loaf <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  before/with  <START:Food> dinner <END> .Seldom do I find myself speaking poorly of a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ...in fact, this is my first critical review of a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  on Yelp.
 <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  friendly.Dropped in for some  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with the  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  one night. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  was pretty standard but the  <START:Service> service <END>  was the great and best part of this business.  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  was attentive and pleasent.My son was given a high  <START:A_Furniture> chair <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>   had fun giving  <START:S_Staff> him <END>  custom little  <START:F_FoodItem> fruits <END>  with bird faces  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  loved  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> !Recommend the banana  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:Food> dish <END> !!

Am I in Heaven?  I think I'm in love with this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  One of my besties' took me to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> brunch <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's when I fell in love.  Yeah, I went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for the Red Velvet Waffles w/  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  drizzled on top because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  sound intriguing but  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  wasn't the highligh of my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .  When we walked into this beautiful  <START:Ambience> establishment <END> , I loved the soft and easy low-key tones of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  I felt like we were in a movie.  Although  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was packed, the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  was very relaxing and comforting.  The  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  of the  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  for me was definitely the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>  sausage ( <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  is made fresh at the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ).   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is so delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I am still at a loss for words!   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is definitely something  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you'd have to try for yourself.  So let me back up a bit,  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the red velvet waffles,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>  sausage, and stone ground  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  w/  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .   Lately, I have to admit, I have not liked anyone's  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  besides my own, but let me tell you...if you're craving  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  and you don't want to make  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  yourself--give this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  a try.  I personally cannot  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back and try other things on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .
The  <START:Food> food <END>  is better than average fast  <START:Food> food <END> . I especially liked the  <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> 
I know  <START:S_Staff> people <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but I am not sure what  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the hubbub is about.  I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on a Friday night around 9pm.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was pretty dead. The  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was super loud,  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were weak and over  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tvs <END>  every inch of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , with  <START:A_Entertainment> sports <END> , yuck.
Ok, before I start my actual review, PLEASE READ: when you go to this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is not a "sit and chat" type  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  Japanese ramen  <START:Restaurant> shop <END>  where you eat your ramen fast and leave. Not trying to sound rude or pushy, but please respect this Japanese tradition. Plus, the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  gets really long really fast, especially at noon.The spicy Tonkotsu Ramen is my favorite.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's always listed as a  <START:Offers> special <END> . I get  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  added in. I LOVE  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  is my second favorite. My parents love the cold  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  too.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just such a unique  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  despite being so short. But hey, studies  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  with fewer  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> , you're usually happier. If you aren't full after one bowl, you can ask for a refill of  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  for (I believe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's $2). But  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  won't give you extra broth for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END> , so save enough broth if you know you'll need another  <START:S_Staff> serving <END> .
Not great, not awful.  I just wasn't terribly impressed....  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  keeps telling me how great  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are but I didn't think  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:Offers> special <END> .    <START:Restaurant> they <END>  do give you a TON of  <START:F_Drinks> them <END> .... my husband and I split a large  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of the Cajun  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and only finished about 1/3 of what  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  gave us.    I did appreciate the large array of  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  available to customize the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  to your liking, especially fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapenos <END> .  Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'll skip the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and stick to the single  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  for a "fast  <START:Food> food <END> "  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was pretty tasty!
Another tasty cheap  <START:Food> meal <END> . Thank you Montreal for being so generous like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . $6 I think for a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END> , and free conversation with the friendly Lebanese man who works  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . Or owns  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Nice  <START:S_Staff> people <END> , good  <START:Food> food <END> , win.
Gotta love filiberto's!  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  messed up on my  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  once and didn't notice until i got home and took a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> ! Only live about 1  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  away so I ran back and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  get me a free  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  quickly made  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  right and also gave me a vip customer  <START:Offers> discount <END>  card to use everytime! The  <START:Food> food <END>  is always yummy!
This  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is truly fresh, tasty,  has a very nice  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  is friendly and informative.Great stuff! Fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  is incredible....and the fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  are just  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> ...FRESH!
Smashburger is one of my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  because I find  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to be tastier than most  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  out  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . I like this new  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  a lot for the same reasons I like the other Smashburger  <START:Ambience> establishments <END>  - tasty  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , friendly and efficient  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , bright and clean  <START:A_Decor> interiors <END>  and exterior, a comfy  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  for al fresco dining. Great  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  too, in a shopping  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is not too busy so  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  is not a problem. I guess my only "complaint" is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is only 2 blocks from my gym, making  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  hard to resist when I pass by hungry after a workout ;)
I have been dying to try this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  because I am a big fan of the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . I will keep this review very simple for you. Three wordsOversaltedOverpricedOverratedCheeseburger,  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  at Smashburger= $10Cheeseburger,  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  at In n Out= $ 6.59How's  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  for simple?
Came in and was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  before a party of six, we were 3 adults and 2 babies. The party of 6 was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  next to us. The  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  took our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and I told  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  I was ready to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  would be  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  soon to take our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ( where's the real  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> ) after  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  we finally got our  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and next to us got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . I once again reminded the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  we were ready to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  now another 10  <START:S_Del_Time> mins <END>  went by and the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  went to the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  next to us and took  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and completely ignored us! Horrible we  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  got up and left!
I went to Pura Vida this morning at 7:10 to avoid any long  <START:S_Del_Time> waits <END> . I usually go to bed at 6 AM so I was surprised I was still up. I talked to Cindy about my Groupon options and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was very helpful. I ended up with the Latin'Tude and Tha Waffle. Everything  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is made fresh and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . So even though I was  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  first customer, I had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  40  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for my togo. I had no problem with  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I came home and ate a third of Tha Waffle.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fluffy and the hint of  <START:F_Ingredients> cinnamon <END>  was perfect. I have yet to try my Latin'tude. Cindy did suggest calling ahead of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  or placing a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  the night before if I was in a rush next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a cute little spot with great  <START:Food> food <END> ! I'll be coming back.
 <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END>  are excellent, I drive across town for this one.  The little sweet lady  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  owns and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is a doll.
I grew up in Michigan and one of my favorite Mongolian stir fry  <START:A_LocatedArea> places <END>  anywhere was within driving distance. Unfortunately,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are not in Phoenix. And since moving  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  I've been looking for another  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get my fix.Genghis Grill is the best I've found yet in the  <START:A_OutsideView> valley <END> . Not quite a perfect replacement but I certainly think  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is pretty good. Choosing your  <START:F_Ingredients> starch <END>  was a nice touch. Not  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  feels like  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> .I feel like some of the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  are pretty  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>  but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  does give you the ability to experiment. Also  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are options on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  for kids  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  may not be into stir fry.The only complication we had for  <START:Service> service <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we both went to build our  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> . While gone, our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  was bussed. Having some sort of card  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  says someone is at this  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  may deal with  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  possible confusion. Also if you decide you want more than 1 bowl, having to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  can be frustrating. I understand  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  makes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  easier to figure out who got 1 bowl vs  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  you can eat. But when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is busy, you may be  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  a while if you want seconds or (somehow) thirds.
For the last 6 months ive been hitting up HOT n JUICY atleast 3  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  a month. Im still not  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burned <END>  out from  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  haha. Every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we hit  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  up we would alwayse  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  something different from the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and each  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we are never disapointed. The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is soooooo yummy,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I sometime  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  to go so I could eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  the next day. I love this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  alot better than the first one cause its not as busy, you don't have to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  40  <START:S_Del_Time> mins <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> :) I personally can not stand  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  more than 20  <START:S_Del_Time> mins <END>  nomatter how good the  <START:Food> food <END>  is. This  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  got my stamp of approval :)
Vegans get a bad rap.  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  seem to think  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  we eat are sprouts and  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> . We  <START:F_FoodItem> eats <END>  so much more and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is outright delicious! Green is the best example of vegan comfort  <START:Food> food <END> !  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  even  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> ! Even if you are not vegan you totally have to try this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Excellent  <START:Food> food <END> , friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  as well as a really enjoyable  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . Try the por boy  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  as well as the great  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are my favorite! You forget  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are not made out of real  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> .Love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
 <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was good & so was the  <START:Food> food <END> . Decent  <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END> . Not my number 1  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but heck of a lot better than any more easy of Nevada!
Margarita  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   was like out of a  <START:F_FI_Quality> box <END>  from grocery  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  weird . The hummus was not authentic . The  <START:F_Drinks> smoothies <END>  were  <START:F_Drinks> watered <END>  down  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  I can  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  was the powder or syrup  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  used to blended . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  breast  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  my sister got was sooo small  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  looked like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was for a 6 year old child not an adult.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was very over  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> juice <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  we spend almost $50 for the both if us for  <START:Food> lunch <END> &  the funny thing we were still hungry the  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  are really small. We really want  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to like this new  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not for us.
Oh, those pepperoni  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> !!!I've had nothing but good  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END>  with Vocelli since moving  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  this past May - in fact, this was the first  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  from, since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was so late by the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we got  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the only  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  open.  The online  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  system  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have is slick and user-friendly,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are always coupons, and the  <START:Food> food <END>  has always been hot and delicious on arrival. I'm holding back from giving  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  because the only things  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  really wow me (and boy, do  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  wow me) are the pepperoni  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and the breadsticks.  The small  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  are a great  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  for two, the "Neapolitan"  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>  (kind of like a thinner, round Sicilian) is inventive and delicious, and the boneless  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are reliably good (if unimaginative).  The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  sticks aren't really  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , the " <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tenders 'taliano" were a little greasy, and the hoagies weren't  <START:Food> anything <END>  to write home about.  Go with the classics, and ask for extra  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> !(The fiance weighs in: The regular  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are good, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tenders 'taliano are fine, the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is REALLY great!, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  and boneless  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are underwhelming.  "And the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  sticks,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , whatever the ****  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  call  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , is NOT  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>  trying.")
Verrrrrrrrrry good. Nice  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . I had fried green  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END> , , greens & the  <START:A_Places> house <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  were awesome! But the best of the best was the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:Food> chocolate <END>  sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> !
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great and allows you to eat what you like and as much or little as you would like. I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and frequent  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  often. Great for large parties
After unexpectedly ending up Downtown on a Wednesday night and not being able to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  at Butcher and the Rye, my husband and I decided to try Vallozzi's for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  On a few previous occasions, I had  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  in the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  during happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  with friends.  The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  was always good, the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  delicious, and the apps tasty, but I had never actually eaten in the dining  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> .After my dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  last night, I think I'll only be returning for  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  in the future. Let me first say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:Service> service <END>  was probably the best part of the  <START:Food> meal <END> .  Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was polite, amiable, and very attentive.  I didn't have to flag  <START:S_Staff> him <END>  down once, although  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was taking care of several  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  around us.  The  <START:Food> food <END> , on the other hand, was a different story.   <START:Food> dinner <END>  started out well, as I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> shishito peppers <END>  and was in heaven.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  and appropriately  <START:F_Ingredients> salted <END> /oiled.  For my  <START:Food> meal <END>  I had butternut  <START:F_FoodItem> squash <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  was so sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I couldn't finish the small bowl.  I also shared brussels sprouts with my husband and was pretty disappointed by the amount of  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  in the  <START:Food> dish <END> . (I didn't even realize  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  sprouts could  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  unhealthy until I had these!) My husband had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  chop ( <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  was fried) and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was generally happy with  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  selection.Overall, our  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was okay, but I certainly won't be rushing back anytime soon.
I just saw someone's review about the savory  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END> , lol,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  was described as tasting like  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the same thing and I guess  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  kind of did now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I think about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I liked  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  though,  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  pretty good to me and hit the spot for me but I can't understand where  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  person was coming from. The  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  was about $12 and for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  amount, yeah, I want  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to be less "soupy" and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would have been nice to see the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cook <END>  stuff the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  in front of me instead of crouching down into a " <START:A_Furniture> fridge <END> " to  <START:F_FoodItem> wrap <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  up. <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  was average and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  were good, just way overpriced for a walk up joint. For the same amount we spent for this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , we could have gone to a French  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> -but its good if you are just trying to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and go. The  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  is a bit long but staring and looking at the  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END>  and  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:A_Decor> fountain <END>  can help distract the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .I personally wouldn't make this a destination but might consider  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  again if I were in the  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> . <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have a general  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is on a first come first  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  basis next to the counter.
Mike's great  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  and enviorment make this a wonderful spot regardless if Chicago  <START:A_Entertainment> sports <END>  are your thing...........One couldn't ask for a more engaging host or  better  <START:Food> food <END> !   I would highly recommend  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to anyone.
Mom's out of town for Thanksgiving so what do two grown men do???   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  go out to eat!  This  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  brought us to Ben & Jacks in Old Town.  I've eaten at Peter Luger's in New York but never one of Ben & Jacks spin-offs so I was excited to try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  The  <START:Food> dinner <END>  started off at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  for a  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END> .  Guinness on draft is always a good idea but in a 10oz glass doesn't quite seem right.  The Stoli and Tonic I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  was great but again the glassware made for a short pour. When the check came, almost 22 dollars for the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END> .  I don't care how high-end you are,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's absurd  <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END> .   Continuing on with our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END>  fiasco we were moved from the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  where we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a bottle of Panna for our flat  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> ...Always a good  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  when a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:Service> serves <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , but as we came to find when the check came, 10 dollars was the going  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  liter of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . Did I mention the word absurd?!?  I don't know if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are trying to recoup  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  start up  <START:F_FI_Price> fees <END>  in 2 weeks but at this pace  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  just might!   Moving on to the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:S_Menu> choice <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   seemed to be a little bit more reasonable as we saw a bottle of the Raymond Cabernet  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  at 18 dollars a glass  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  would have ideally put the bottle at about 70 dollars, I say ideally because the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  didn't have a  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  by the bottle for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  ...I thought nothing of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  but was definitely ready to try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and get some  <START:Food> food <END>  in our tummies.... Things looked like  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were looking up!We then moved to the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  promptly after  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and were met by our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> .  No  <START:Offers> specials <END>  given  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  of the Thanksgiving Day Pre-Fix  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  so we just  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  Dad started with the  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END>  on the Half Shell ($13.95.  Great  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and plenty of horseradish and  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  to season! I wasn't so luck with my Baked Clams($13.95).  These little neck clams were 6 to the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  and just  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> ....LITTLE!  While the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  was decent, the  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  could definitely use an adjustment. I also found  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a tad overwhelming  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  moved my clams from one  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  to the other and then  <START:Offers> seasoned <END>  with the extra white  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  reduction.  Maybe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just me, but I don't like being  <START:Service> served <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . Sprinkle some  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END> , grate some  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  but no touching the  <START:Food> food <END> ...Well now to  <START:Food> dinner <END> , and good thing I was still hungry after the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  because the Prime Ribeye($45.95) I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   was massive.  The bone-in  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  eye was done perfectly medium with a Gorgonzola reduction I requested on the side.  Dad got the same with some sort of Au Jus...  <START:S_Staff> his <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  Medium Rare and again perfectly done.  As a side we shared the German Potatoes(13.95) Kind of pricey for a side but good overall  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  After the  <START:Food> meal <END>  absolutely no  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  to try a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  so we asked for the check.  When  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  came I opened  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and almost gave back  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  my  <START:Food> food <END> .  Not for  <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  but the  <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END>  on the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> .  The Raymond Cabernet came out at $90.  I don't know who is doing the math in the accounting office but  you're definitely in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  for a raise! Long and the short of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ... <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  were phenomenal, Antonio the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was great but everything else was mediocre at best.  Too many  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  members running around and seemed like a lot of disorganization.
Beautiful  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:A_Decor> decor <END> . Love the text you when your  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  is ready.  But why does one go to a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  at this  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> ? You want amazing  <START:Food> food <END> .   The  <START:Food> food <END>  is plentiful but nothing is great,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  blah, blah with a side of blah. Sure you get  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs(hot or chilled)  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  (too warm) dumplings ( <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  frozen),  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  (cardboard) prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  (no  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> ) the rest is standard. Fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , Mexican, Italian, Chinese, blah blah blah.  Nothing was out of the ordinary, interesting or gave me  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  WOW I thought I would have. If I'm  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  this  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  I want unique, non typical, amazing  <START:Food> food <END> . Mediocre doesn't cut  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Sorry Caesars,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  hype and no substance.$58 was the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  Sunday night.  <START:Service> service <END>  was top notch. $10 for tip total. $68 for one person.   $$$$
I was driving by when the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> attracted <END>  me to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  I totally dig this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a tiny stage  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  hangs over the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with a great  <START:A_Entertainment> guitarist <END>  playing on this Friday night.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was unique and tasty.  I wasn't in a hurry and the pace of  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was relaxed so if your in a hurry do drive thru at Taco Bell.  But If your looking for an evening  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to take a  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>  and you don't want break the bank this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great!
For some obscure reason, I start singing songs from 'Bambi' in my head when I think of 'Woodland Creatures'. I just wish the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  filled me with as much delight as Disney movies usually do!I was quite looking forward to  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  a visit, as I'd heard lots of good things, and I finally got my chance one Saturday night. On first impressions, the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  have done a great job with the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> , both inside & out, but I think I was expecting  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to be a wee bit quirkier (perhaps more woodlandy, a few more animals & maybe some unusual feature...like toilets hidden inside a tree  <START:A_Decor> themed <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END>  or something!).The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was well stocked,  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  were normal and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were friendly... <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  just seemed to lack  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  for me. I'm having real difficulty putting my finger on the exact problem, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  really did make me feel a bit 'meh' (or maybe some other creature related noise).I'd like to give Woodland Creatures another try so I can hopefully update my  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  rating but, until then,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's only 2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for my night in the woods.
I don't understand the trend of celebrity  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>  slapping  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  names on any  <START:Ambience> establishment <END> . This trend seems particularly prevalent in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> . Where is the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  control?Pub 1842 provides an average  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Everything is edible but not particularly memorable or delicious. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was fine. I will have to say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  we visited in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  includes Gordon Ramsay Pub, Mesa Grill, Spago, DOCG and others, the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  at Michael Mina Pub was the only one to refold my  <START:S_Cutlery> napkin <END>  when I left the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  have been trained  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .If you find yourself at MGM with no  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat, Michael Mina Pub would probably be fine. You'll leave feeling  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you overpaid, but  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  happens almost  <START:A_Environment> everywhere <END>  in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> .
" <START:A_Decor> butterflies <END> !  <START:A_Decor> butterflies <END> !  <START:A_Decor> butterflies <END> !" <START:A_Decor> butterflies <END>  are pretty much  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  my toddler would talk about today after our visit to Butterfly Wonderland.  I didn't really have expectations going in to check this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  out; I only knew  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were newly opened and had lots of  <START:A_Decor> butterflies <END>  and a 3D butterfly movie.  I went with Alexa M (my sister-in-law) and my two kids (both under 2).  Luckily the kids were free because my adult ticket was $18.95 and Alexa's student ticket was $16.95... kind of pricey for what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is!We found  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  of the  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  very friendly -- especially Myrna who took our tickets and gave us our 3D glasses upon entering.   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  even gave my son an extra butterfly stamp on  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  hand since  <START:S_Staff> he <END> 's kind of obsessed with both stamps and  <START:A_Decor> butterflies <END> !  And while  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  wouldn't sit still for the movie,  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  absolutely loved seeing the  <START:A_Decor> butterflies <END>  in the atrium despite the humidity.   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  also loved the  <START:A_Decor> fountain <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  (both indoors and out).The  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  and  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END>  were satisfactory but overpriced.  Even so, this is a fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to visit with the kids or without.  If you're looking for an activity to eat up an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  or two max, and you have some extra $$ to spend, I do recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ... We actually ended up getting annual passes since my son liked  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  so much.
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  looks really cool. Too bad the  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  was not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  good 'Watery"....if you want to eat real Japanese  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  just go across the street to Zen  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> .
Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  yesterday and the Italian  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was so good.  Great  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .
I had a great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  Yesterday  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wrap <END> , jalapeño  <START:F_FoodItem> poppers <END>  and a couple of  kid  <START:Food> meals <END>  where whAt you would expect - good however, the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , made  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  especially good.   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was kind and very prompt.   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  made sure our kids were taken care of and we never had to ask for  <START:Food> anything <END> .   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was wonderful.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was rewarded with a big compliment to the  <START:S_Staff> manger <END>  and a very generous tip. Thank you so much Vern. You are awesome!
I was actually kind of excited to visit this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , however my entire  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was negative. We came on a Sunday the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  was kinda cool and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was pretty full. We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  immediately. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  looked like  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  had something better to do and when I asked if I had  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  didn't have  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> combo <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  didn't make the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Understandable. But  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attitude <END>  never changed. My boyfriend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and loved  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and then we decided to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> pazookie <END> . Huge mistake. After 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  came and said the  <START:F_FoodItem> pazookie <END>  was dropped on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are getting a new one. We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  another 30  <START:S_Del_Time> mins <END>  for our new one and when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  finally came we were excited to eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Upon diving in we moved the  <START:F_Dessert>   ice     cream   <END>  over and seriously found a pubic hair in our  <START:F_FoodItem> pazookie <END>  between the I've  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> cookie <END> . Completely ruined our  <START:F_Appetizer> appetite <END> . Because of our overall  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  I will not be returning and would not recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to anybody looking for an uplifting  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat. Thumbs down.
My company moved into a new  <START:Ambience> building <END>  in Tempe yesterday and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:Service> treated <END>  us to  <START:F_FoodItem> donuts <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  from Fractured Prune.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were fabulous.  Not your usual boring  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> .  Very innovative and tasty.  Loved the Bold  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  too.  I hadn't heard of  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  before - but now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I have, I'll go back on my own.
let a tip. check  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out. this is my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  using Yelp and thought I was writing a review.
I have been to the Waterworks Burgatory as well as the spot at Consol Arena and the  <START:Food> food <END>  truck at Mario's Livingroom. I have enjoyed  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> . So, when  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  opened in the Waterfront, I was very excited. As a Waterfront "local", I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for a while before venturing over  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . New  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  openings  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  always attract a huge crowd. Today, my husband and I went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  at noon.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was busy but the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  was only 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> . I gave my cell number to the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  and even though I got a text to see the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  because my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  was ready,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't ready when I went inside. We had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  to clear and wipe the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  before being  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> . My brother had recommended the Espresso Love  <START:F_Drinks> shake <END> . I've had  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  hard  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  before, so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_Drinks> shake <END>  and so did my husband. The  <START:F_Drinks> tequila <END>  in the  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  were overpowering. Never before have I had a Burgatory hard  <START:F_Drinks> shake <END>  where the  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  was so overwhelming. Even the man at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  next to us made mention of the same thing. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  who took our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  was very nice, but one  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  brought us our  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  and a completely different  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  brought us our  <START:Food> meals <END> . I hope  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  tip share because other than taking our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and taking away our empty  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  and things,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  did little else. The  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  of today was a  <START:F_FoodItem> chorizo <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  on top. My husband  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  and said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the  <START:F_FI_Quality> dryest <END>  thing  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  had ever  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  made comparisons to the Sahara and the Gobi when describing this   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . I did a Create your Own  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>    <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with provolone,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END>  and a sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  rub on the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> . I have to cut most  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  in half and when I cut this in half,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  just oozed greasy. The bottom of the  <START:F_Ingredients> wheat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  was saturated with greasy  <START:F_Drinks> juices <END> . Also,  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  assembly of the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  goes against  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  conventional thinking  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END> , in this case, was NOT a good thing.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  put the cold  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END>  against the hot provolone  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , then the  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  and then put the sauteed  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  on top of the  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  so  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  fell out  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  over the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Whoever cleared this  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  to be  <START:Service> served <END>  was NOT  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  attention or doesn't know what  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are looking at as my  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  were  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  over the basket before I even laid eyes on my  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . The sea  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  and herb  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  needs to drop the herbs.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  don't suit the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  don't suit  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  clash. I had to use a lot of  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END>  to cover the herb  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . I might come back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  if i'm just going to have a short  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> , but not for a full  <START:Food> meal <END> . I was sadly disappointed with Burgatory after  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  my great previous  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END>  with  <START:F_Drinks> them <END> . I know  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  will get my business when I go to a Pens  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> .
Man, I love Babystacks! The Summerlin  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  was created such a great vibe, I was really putting some big expectations on this new  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> . The best part:  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's literally a mile away from my  <START:A_Places> house <END> !  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's a score!Just like the first  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is busy! On the weekends (and probably the weekdays as well) be prepared to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> ! My  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  wasn't bad though, just 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>   <START:A_Places> station <END>  with some  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  and lots of standing  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> . When you enter the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , you'll notice lots of  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  top  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  and some  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's big  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tvs <END>  for the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and some  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  top  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  as well. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was awesome. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was such a sweet lady.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  us within 2  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  and kept checking back with us. We actually got our  <START:Food> food <END>  before the guests  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  sat 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  before we did! Now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's efficient :)For  <START:Food> brunch <END> , I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> spam <END>  Scramble for $7.95. Three scrambled  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  with diced  <START:F_FoodItem> spam <END> , sprinkled with  <START:F_Ingredients> furikake <END>  and a  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  upgrade for $1.00 more. The  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> furikake <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> onions <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  were awesome! I love  <START:F_FoodItem> spam <END>  and love the  <START:F_FI_Taste> saltiness <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , complimenting the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  very nicely. The  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was on point, just as I remembered. The ONLY problem with this  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  was the  <START:A_Places> portion <END> . OMG,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was sooo small!  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  took up only 75% of the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . I ate everything within 2  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END> . I definitely think  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have bigger  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  in the Summerlin  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> . For my side, I decided to upgrade with a babystack of Red Velvet. Red velvet  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> , topped with whipped  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  and  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  crumbles,  <START:Service> served <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  syrup. OH-EM-GEE, just has I remembered! The  <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END>  were moist and so  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  really made the red  <START:F_FoodItem> velvet pop <END>  out and the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  crumbles accented the  <START:Food> dish <END>  very well. DEFINITELY A MUST TRY!I'm so glad this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  opened by my  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I can literally come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  every weekend without wasting a lot of gas. The next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I come, though, I hope  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  address this  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> issue <END> . Whether or not, I'm still coming back... <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  again!
