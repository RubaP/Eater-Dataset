Went with a galpal for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  not  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  ago. The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was, well,  <START:Food> it <END>  was like a glorified  <START:A_Entertainment> sports <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . The  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was loud, but upbeat and  <START:Food> it <END>  was packed with college age kids watching a  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> . The  <START:A_Ent_Tv> flat screens <END>  are nice, but  <START:Food> it <END> 's not my  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  for watching  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> long <END> .  <START:Food> lunch <END>  was ok,  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  aren't bad. The  <START:Food> fries <END>  took so  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  to come out  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> , who was a riot, came to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and looked at us and says, deadpan, I'm going in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  to make your  <START:Food> fries <END> . I'll be right back. Five or so  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> later <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END> 's got a  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END>  stain on his shirt and  <START:Food> fries <END>  in his hand. I don't know if  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  actually made  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  or not, but I got a kick out of  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . I give  <START:Food> it <END>  an A-OK for a  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  hangout but all around I'm pretty underwhelmed by  <START:Food> it <END> .
I can't believe this gem has no reviews.  I stopped by America's Taco  <START:Restaurant> shop <END>  the other night expecting something similar to what I get at El Rinconcito.  No comparison whatsoever.  The carne asada  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  are far superior and much for sizeable.  Sure the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  isn't nearly as  <START:A_Decor> fancy <END> , but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is excellent.  The  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  are  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END>  but you will likely need to brush up on your Spanish before you go.  I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
Great  <START:Service> service <END>  & great  <START:Food> food <END> ! Brought a  <START:A_Env_Size> group <END>  of 13, 5 being small children.  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  was so kind!!!
Good sign when the crowd includes policemen, firemen, business and more importantly locals.  Another good sign when my 3 and 4 year old make me  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  not one extra  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  but two  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  so  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  could get thirds.
4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  just because how could I give Taco Bell 5??To start, I am biased towards  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wrapped <END>  in a  <START:Food> tortilla <END> ..  I love  <START:Food> it <END> ..  Put  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  or  <START:F_Dessert> ice cream <END>  in a  <START:Food> tortilla <END> , and  <START:Food> it <END>  is just  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  much better.  Short of the extreme of the Taco  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  SNL  <START:A_Decor> sketch <END>  (google  <START:Food> it <END> ),  <START:F_FoodItem> wrap <END>  my  <START:Food> meal <END>  in a  <START:Food> tortilla <END>  to go!Ok, as for Taco Bell, for the most part you know what you are going to get.  While I have had a few 7-layer  <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  were "off" in the past, for the most part,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is little surprise.I just want to commend this particular  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  because  <START:Food> it <END>  is probably the busiest Taco Bell I have ever seen.  Any day M-F and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a mad house at  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  Thankfully,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are super fast on servicing both the " <START:Restaurant> here <END> " and "To Go"  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> ..   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's  <START:Food> it <END> ..  4 starts for a Taco Bell  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Delivery> delivers <END>  the highest  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  fast  <START:Food> food <END>  mexican at the fastest  <START:Restaurant> pace <END> !
Just tried this  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ....although I have lived in the neighborhood 7 yrs...   The  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have on their brochure depicts a nicely browned and bubbly  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  reflecting lots of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  actually looked like  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ...Unfortunately the actual  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  looks absolutely nothing like the  <START:A_Decor> picture <END> ...I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> pepperoni <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was 2 slices  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  had 2  pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> pepperoni <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> rest <END>   had one little  <START:F_FoodItem> pepperoni <END>  on each slice.The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is very  <START:Food> doughy <END> ....the  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  are sparse and the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  is a paper thin layer  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  resembles a dominoes or papa john type.....In essence....for $7.40 appox for a 1  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  will do when you just crave  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and have little funds ...Remember....you get what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for!   I do have to compliment  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  on the quaint eating  <START:A_Places> area <END>  ....just a few  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  but very  <START:A_Environment> homey <END>  feeling.....very nice  <START:S_Staff> employees <END> .I am not sure if I will try  <START:Food> it <END>  again....
Good  <START:Food> food <END> .   <START:Service> decent <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END> .  Over  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> .
Keeping this short and sweet:  The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like the  <START:Food> food <END>  you get in Thailand.  Authentic enough for you Phoenix?
This was our second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  having china rainbow, and I can officially say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I am a fan. I decided we would try this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  because  <START:Food> it <END>  has two unusual  <START:F_Ingredients> proteins <END>  for a valley  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> duck <END> . I'm used to these at nicer  <START:Restaurant> resturants <END>  back east but not out  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . My wife had the Yuling  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we went and I can say  <START:Food> it <END>  was great. A full  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  breast fried in  <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END>  and perfect with the delicious yuling  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and I had hunan  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  good and spicy...super spicy and tasty. I didn't  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  for the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> chestnuts <END>  in the  <START:F_FoodItem> wonton <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  otherwise  <START:Food> it <END>  was good. Tonight we got takeout and I took the plunge and got the yuling  <START:F_Ingredients> duck <END>  and the wife got  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  "highly recommends" the  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and for good reason,  <START:Food> it <END>  was really good. I would  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  for myself everytime we go but I'm gonna try something new next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . I got the fried  <START:F_FoodItem> wonton <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  which was a waste of  <START:O_Pay_Price> money <END>  even if  <START:Food> it <END>  was just $3  <START:Food> it <END>  was just fried  <START:F_FoodItem> wonton <END>  wrappers with no filling I was expecting actual  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  fried wontons or for  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  to be stuffed with something. Still a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with really good and very reasonably  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .
drove up to wickenburg w/friends to have  <START:Food> lunch <END>  we decided to try anitas . i had the carne asada  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  w/ <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  were smokey and flavorfull  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  were very good as well wife had the  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rellenos <END>  good  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  our friends  <START:Food> meals <END>  were brought to  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  switched  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  so  <START:Food> it <END>  took our friends a few  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to figure  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  out.. <START:Service> service <END>  was good (except for the  <START:F_Ingredients> mix <END>  up) will defenetly return  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  also do  <START:Food> breakfast <END> 
Worst  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  I've ever had! So soggy and too much  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I hate  <START:Food> it <END>  when the crust is soggy!!!
I'm not sure what else to say about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  hasn't been already said. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is LEGIT.  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> lines <END>  are  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  but goes fast.  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  has always been fresh as can be when I go  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is the best I have tried in the south so far.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was top notch also. The south for sure is very very nice and  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END>  and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is no exception.This is my  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat again when coming back to NC.
 <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have good  <START:Food> food <END>  and I love their Hot  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END> !
"EAT MO BETTAH!' I sure did!Walk into this small  <START:Ambience> building <END> ,  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  your  <START:Food> food <END>  from a super chill lay back  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> later <END>  you feel like you in New Orleans. The commercial for Zatarain's was playing in my mind the whole  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I was eating. But so much better then the box  <START:F_FoodItem> stuff <END> .Would recommend the Mardi Gras Combo (red  <START:F_FoodItem>   bean  &rive <END> , jambalaya &  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  creole) because most of the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I can't make up my mind. Now the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  Étouffée is said to be very, very hot. So I got a half  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to play  <START:Food> it <END>  safe. For me I've had spicier  <START:Food> food <END>  elsewhere. Don't get me wrong  <START:Food> it <END> 's hot put not with 2 verys. I was kinda let down by this cause I LOVE spicy  <START:Food> food <END> . Hotter the better.
I love  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ! Their sizzling  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  is awesome, and you usually get enough for three  <START:Food> meals <END> . Lots of  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:S_Menu> options <END> , and my husband loves their  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  (as did I when I used to eat  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ). Ask for  <START:Food> it <END>  spicy --  <START:Food> it <END> 's delish!
If I lived in Vegas, I would be  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  ALL the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . LOVE.  <START:Food> things <END>  to dig:Its pretty. Really. Love the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  and  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> . <START:Service> service <END> . I am a whore for good  <START:Service> service <END> . FRESH. SUPER FRESH. UBER FRESH. yay  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> !Fave apps:1. Wok Fried Calamari and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> - lightly fried and golden with a sweet and spicy dip laced with  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . 2. Korabuta  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Potstickers- extra  <START:Offers> special <END>  potstickers, not at all greasy with an awesome  <START:F_Ingredients> ginger <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .3.  <START:F_Ingredients> filo <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wrapped <END>  Tiger  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END> - shredded  <START:F_Ingredients> filo <END>  envelops these gigantic  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are laid in a  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END> - <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is out of this world.Fave  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> :1. Little Buddha  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> - this is one of  <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  where  <START:Food> it <END>  is a lot, but  <START:Food> it <END>  all just goes together. The  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  is awesome and of  <START:S_Menu> course <END>  anytime you have spicy and sweet together I am a fan. 2. Fantasy  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> - light and fresh. The  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  is real and king and the  <START:F_FoodItem> halibut <END>  is thin on top.3. Palm's  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> - killer Naruto, not too spicy.I am not a fan of spicy  <START:Food> food <END> , but  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  else loves the  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeno <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> yellowtail <END> . And I have to admit, the only  <START:Food> entree <END>  I have tried is the  <START:F_FoodItem> fried   rice   <END>  :)Sake  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is great,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have  <START:F_FoodItem> mochi <END>  for after  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pistachio <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> creme brulee <END>  is to die for. Pretty expensive, but this is Vegas. Unless you leave the  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END> , this is what you will  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>   <START:Restaurant> everywhere <END> . Plus, the Palms is very generous with  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:A_Ent_Music> comps <END> . Get a  <START:O_Pay_Method> card <END>  even if you aren't playing much and you might be  <START:O_Experience> surprised <END>  how much you  <START:Offers> get off <END>  your  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  (just give  <START:Food> it <END>  to your  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  will take  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  of  <START:Food> it <END> ). Of  <START:S_Menu> course <END> ,  <START:A_Ent_Music> comps <END>  can't cover  <START:Service> tip <END> . Single gripe:  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  don't have  <START:F_FoodItem> tamago <END>  :(
Overall 3.5 starsGold medal - sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  Silver medal - uniBronze medal -  gyozaIf you are looking for  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  then  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  coma is better.  If you are looking for  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  at Yama are really yum.The sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  at Yama is really good.   <START:Food> it <END>  is large  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimps <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fry <END>  the head.The  <START:F_FoodItem> uni <END>  was fresh and super creamy.

Super  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , so try to get  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  early.Happy Sushiing!!
I love Fuji.  I have been coming to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for as  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  as I can remember because  <START:Food> it <END>  has been my entire life.  Since  <START:Food> it <END>  is one of my grandfather's favorite  <START:Restaurant> places <END> , I have been sat in a  <START:A_Furniture> highchair <END>  at Fuji as well as celebrated my college graduation with friends and  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> .  The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is simple, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is always solid.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END>  and not as slow as some other reviews suggest.  And the  <START:Food> food <END>  is totally authentic home-style Japanese.   <START:Food> it <END>  reminds me of my grandmother's  <START:Food> food <END>  - a memory  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   has not been invoked by any other Japanese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .Consistent and delicious, you can count on Fuji to fulfill a Japanese craving.
Every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I come  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the Snow White  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> .  Amazing.  I don't know exactly all  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  put in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , but the  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  goes on  <START:Food> it <END> , is what makes  <START:Food> it <END>  so amazing.I've done the AYCE  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .   <START:Food> it <END>  is a bit pricey and will only be  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  if you're a big eater.  Oh, and make sure you finish  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  on  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , otherwise,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  will  <START:O_Payment> charge <END>  you a la carte for  <START:Food> it <END> .
I had the  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  chops in a  <START:F_Drinks> balsamic <END>  Serrano  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  reduction  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The chose I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  medium rare. The  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  was saturated in this  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  which was incredibly over powering, too vinegary and really needed to reduce longer or use a better  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_Drinks> balsamic <END> . I had this  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in my mouth for days.  <START:Food> it <END>  was edible but I don't feel was executed properly and for the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  I would expect  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . When i told the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said  <START:Food> it <END> 's not for  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END> . I explained  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the issue was the  <START:F_Ingredients> vinegar <END>  was over powering and if  <START:Food> it <END>  was properly done  <START:Food> it <END>  should be more sweet than  <START:F_Ingredients> vinegar <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  chops were a little over done  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  medium well-ish and were and effort to cut. The  <START:F_FoodItem> tamale <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  with  <START:Food> it <END>  was underwhelming at best. My friend had the  <START:F_FoodItem> ciopinno <END> , and  <START:Food> it <END>  was phenomenal.. I was very  very jealous of his  <START:Food> dish <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was lovely to share with me. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  of the  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END>  was sensational, I could  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  the  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .We had the  <START:F_Ingredients> hibiscus <END>   <START:F_Drinks> margaritas <END> , which I loved! The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  at the beginning was interesting. Some I liked more than others. the  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeno <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  I felt just had a weird  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> , and the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> baking soda <END>  was intense. My husband didn't seem to notice. The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  definitely leaves something to be desires. I feel more as if i am in some high  <START:Ambience> ceiling <END> -ed  <START:Restaurant> cafeteria <END>  with  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  cloths.  <START:Food> it <END> 's not romantic or  <START:Offers> special <END> , more of a  <START:A_Entertainment> cattle call <END> . I think the  <START:A_Decor> design <END>  could have lent a little more to the  <START:A_Environment> intimacy <END>  and  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of enjoying the  <START:Food> food <END> . Again, for the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  I have had better for less. Based on my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and for the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , I would say I expected more.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> ciopinno <END>  is what saved my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . I might try this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  again if I was with a  <START:A_Env_Size> group <END>  or  <START:S_Staff> person <END>  who insisted on going but would not get the  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END> , and most likely wouldn't seek  <START:Food> it <END>  out again.
For a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> , this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is not bad at all. Dont get me wrong, I have nothing against  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  chains. In fact,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are pretty good sometimes because you know  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is going to be consistent  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  and you will not be in for a surprise,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is bound to be a regular  <START:Food> dish <END>  off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you like and always  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and so on. We went to Biaggi's for  <START:Food> dinner <END> . After we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> , a  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END>   <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  came up to us and while  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was greeting us, explaining what the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  of the day was,  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was preparing a  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>  oil with  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  on a small  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  simultaneously (talk about multitasking..). After taking our  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  for  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> ,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> warm <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were two types of  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> - one was a regular  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , the other one was.. i dont remember actually. My husband got a  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  -  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:Food> it <END>  was extremely tasty! For  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:S_Menu> course <END> , I got the  <START:F_FoodItem>   penne   sardi <END>  without the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and my husband got the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggplant <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> parmiagana <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem>   penne   sardi <END>  turned out be the best  <START:F_FoodItem> penne <END>  I have ever had so far. With the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> breadcrumbs <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  with a hint of  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  creamy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , this was absolutely great! And, after getting to know the fact  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> , i was pleasantly  <START:O_Experience> surprised <END> , since the overall  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of  <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:Food> food <END>  was way beyond expectation compared to any other  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have a good  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  of  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END> . But their  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:S_Menu> course <END>  is so filling  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you end up taking the  <START:Food> food <END>  home and leave without tasting the  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END> . <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have a good  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  too and usually,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are  <START:S_Menu> suggestions <END>  available for pairing with your  <START:Food> food <END>  as well. When you enter the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , you will find a lot of business cards on a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . These happen to be the business cards of the different  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>  working in the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> . I found this pretty  <START:A_Environment> neat <END>  :)The  <START:A_Places> downside <END>  of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is the  <START:Food> food <END>  is a little over  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> . But I would highly recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .
I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> - the German  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pretzels <END> . Especially the  <START:F_FoodItem> pretzels <END> - one of the tastiest  <START:F_FoodItem> pretzels <END>  I have ever had.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a large  <START:A_Env_Size> group <END>  of us- all very  <START:A_Plc_Bar> drunk <END>  as part of a  <START:A_Environment> bachelor   party   <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waitstaff <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> patent <END>  with us, as Vegas is all about drunken douchebags causing problems. Eventually, after several Nazi jokes and broken  <START:F_Drinks> steins <END> , we got kicked out. What was painful was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we got some  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  in the  <START:Food> food <END>  of the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  next to us, and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  stuck us with part of their  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> ....
Best  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Lived  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  for 5 yrs, and only Indulge  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  comes even  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END> ...but still by a  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  shot. The  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is amazing, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> caprese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  is even to die. The most  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  around. The  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  are delicious, the  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END>  are incredible, and if you don't mind the possibility of a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is great too. Not to mention the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  is off the hook. Something for  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END> . Don't have a take on the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , not a big  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  connoisseur. And also not a red  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  eater, but I bring all of my out of town visitors (from the midwest... <START:Restaurant> they <END>  know their  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ) and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  love  <START:Food> it <END> ! MmmMMmmMMmmm!
Not much for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  just  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> 
Good  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  but a bit expensive all you can eat is $ 30B
Fix  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and Grill is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>   inside the Bellagio  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END> . I  <START:Restaurant> dined <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  only because my sister was getting married at the Bellagio. We had a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  for a  <START:A_Env_Type> party <END>  of 20, if your entire  <START:A_Env_Type> party <END>  can't make  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a $40  <START:O_Pay_Price> fee <END>  per empty  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END> . Our  <START:A_Env_Type> party <END>  was seperated into 3  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have no large  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> . After being  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  we where greeted by several  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  share the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . We were  <START:Service> served <END>  by a very mean  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  gave us total  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attitude <END> , forgot to take one persons  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  at our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  30 mintues for our  <START:Food> food <END> . While the other two  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  ate we sat staring at each other. I spoke to the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  about our  <START:Service> horrible <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  apologized, of  <START:S_Menu> course <END> . Out of our three  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  mine was the only one  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  added the  <START:Service> tip <END>  to our  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> . So my thinking is because we didn't not  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  as much  <START:F_Drinks> liquor <END>  as all the other  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and I spoke to the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  then added the  <START:Service> tip <END>  to my  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  to guarantee  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  got something out of us. My aunt told me  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  because Vegas really has know gauranteed customer returns  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no need to try to impress the customer. SO TRUE.  I do not recommend anyone eating  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at FIX. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was pricey and really didn't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  great.  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:Service> horrible <END>  to say the least and if  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  gives a 1/2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  I would have choosen  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .
My first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ! My children kept talking about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are 19 years old with huge  <START:F_Appetizer> appetites <END>  and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  fits the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> . I had the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  with the absolute best  <START:F_FoodItem> okra <END>  ever as a side. My son had the monster  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with BBQ atop and  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was too tall to  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . I grazed off their  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> . Can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go again. Well  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the  <START:O_Pay_Price> money <END> .....yum yum.
 <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  about what you would expect at a  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END>   <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>   <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> . We ate twice on our trip  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> steel cut oats <END>  both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  on  <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>  was good. No kids  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  so both of my kids had regular  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  on first  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  should have shared one and still would have had one  <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END>  left over. Took the  <START:Food> leftovers <END>  and used  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  as  <START:F_Appetizer> snacks <END>  as we walked the  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END> . The second visit  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  shared a  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> .
absolutely delicious . I am glad I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  early in my vacation ,so I can go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again . I had the  <START:Food> cheesy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelette <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ranch   potatoes   <END>  and a  <START:F_FoodItem> banana nut muffin <END> .  I was looking at the stuffed strawberry French toast, no really I literally was staring at  <START:Food> it <END> , the lady probably thought I was a creeper, but I am getting  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  sometime this week, with a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> ranch   potatoes   <END> .  However, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  sounds good too...I did not get to stare at  <START:Food> it <END>  to report back...sorry.  Whatever you do... <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ranch   potatoes   <END> !!
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is by far the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  i've ever been to!!
I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !!  Very good  <START:Food> food <END>  at reasonable  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END> .  Be prepared for a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  with large groups and at peak  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:Food> it <END> .
What the hell Tom Colicchio?!?!?!  My blindfolded cats can make a better  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> !  I'd give  <START:Food> it <END>  -5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  but I can't. Hubs and I were at the  <START:A_Places> pool <END>  and wanted some  <START:Food> food <END> .  Since we've been  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  fans of Tom on Top Chef we thought we'd give  <START:Food> it <END>  a try.  We weren't  <START:O_Experience> surprised <END>  by the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  ( <START:Food> it <END>  is on the  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END> , after all) and expected the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  to be top notch.  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the slow roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> flank <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  I should've known this was going to be a problem when I didn't see the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheddar <END>  in the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .   <START:Food> it <END>  said "aged  <START:F_FoodItem> cheddar <END> " on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , why wasn't  <START:Food> it <END>  on my sammie??   Ehhhh, I wasn't going to walk all the way back to the  <START:A_Places> eatery <END>  from the  <START:A_Places> pool <END> .  I thought to myself, "I can deal, I'm sure the  <START:F_FoodItem> rest <END>  will be yummy".  Boy was I wrong.  If you like some  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  with a sliver of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and a pound of  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> , this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for you!   I'm pretty sure the high school kid at subway can assemble a nicer  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  than this.  Not only were  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  thrown together,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was barely any  <START:F_FoodItem> stuff <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ...  not to mention my forgotten  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .   And  <START:Food> it <END>  was sooo salty!  Sorely disappointed, Tom.  How come all the other  <START:Food> food <END>  you make on TV looks so good?  You've really  <START:F_FI_Price> cashed <END>  in on your fame.  I'd write him a note expressing my concern but I know  <START:Food> it <END>  won't reach him and  <START:S_Staff> he <END> 's too  <START:A_Env_Type> busy <END>  raking in $$$ to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END> . Looking for a good  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END> ?  Try Earl of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  at Planet Hollywood.
I am across the country and cannot believe how much I miss Manolo's  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> empanadas <END> ! <START:F_FoodItem> empanadas <END> :So many  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> ! My favorites are the  <START:F_FoodItem> pepperoni <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . Stay away from the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> thyme <END> , I thought  <START:Food> it <END>  was awful. I haven't tried their  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> empanadas <END> :  <START:F_Dessert> brownie <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> . The san telmo  <START:Food> anything <END>  is okay if you want more of " <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END> "  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> :The BBQ Meats  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is why I can never become  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END> ! Imagine a super thin  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  crust where BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  substitutes marinara  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Then add  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END> , ground  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pepperoni <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END> . Mmmmmm....You had me at  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END> .I've also enjoyed their other specialty slices.I also have to give credit to Manolo's for having great  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  crust. The thinness of  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> toasts <END>  so well in the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  oven  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you have to hold yourself back from inhaling the entire slice in five  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> . <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> :Limited  <START:A_Places> indoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  and a few  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  when the weather is nice. I suggest taking your  <START:Food> food <END>  and sitting in the Krannert  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> theater <END> .
awesome  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat. I come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  regularly on my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  break in the  <START:Service> service <END>  is always  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END>  I recommend asking  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  to ' <START:F_Ingredients> mix <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  up' for you once your burro is done  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> mix <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  all up before  <START:F_FoodItem> wrapping <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  :)
Very good  <START:Food> food <END> !! Try the fundido  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> !
Don't  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  attention to the snob reviewers. No,  <START:Food> it <END> 's not the best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  in Phoenix. If you have to have the best of  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>   <START:Restaurant> everywhere <END>  you go then  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  says all we need to know about you.If  <START:Food> it <END> 's  <START:A_Env_Type> busy <END> ,  you're going to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .  We call  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  "science". I really liked my  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  each  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I have eaten  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Last trip I spotted someone eating some really good looking  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> . I'll have to try  <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>  next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .Come for a  <START:Service> decent <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ,  a good  <START:Food> meal <END> ,  interesting  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and a great  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  at night.
I've been coming to Chloe's Corner since  <START:Food> it <END>  opened back in the day as "The  <START:A_Places> counter <END> ."   <START:Food> it <END>  is probably one of my favorite  <START:Food> lunch <END>  spots in the  <START:A_Places> area <END> .   <START:Food> it <END>  is quick, yet relaxed...and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is perfect.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have a plethora of  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  I've tried gets my seal of approval.  I usually always get the Classic  <START:F_FoodItem> grilled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  along with a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of their  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> .  I don't know what  <START:Food> it <END>  is about this  <START:F_FoodItem> grilled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , because their really is nothing out of the ordinary about  <START:Food> it <END> , but damn  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are so good.  Dip  <START:Food> it <END>  in the  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:Food> it <END>  is a bit of heaven (or your childhood...).  When I feel like switching  <START:Food> it <END>  up, I'll usually get the  <START:F_Ingredients> chinese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is shredded and the  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> ginger <END> -soy) is so delish....I usually end up  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  an extra side of the  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END>  because I like  <START:Food> it <END>  so much.If you are in the Kierland/Scottsdale Q  <START:A_Places> area <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> , do not hesitate one bit to come into Chloe's Corner for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .   <START:Food> it <END> 's quick, affordable, and tasty.
My  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  has left me with no words. Bad  <START:Service> service <END> . Mediocre  <START:Food> food <END> . I can definitely say I'm never coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again.  <START:Food> it <END>  took over 20  <START:S_Del_Time> mins <END>  to get our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  some  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  didn't own up to  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  mistakes and blamed the busboy for not bringing the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . When we got the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> ,  <START:Food> it <END>  tasted  <START:Service> horrible <END> . Our  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>   <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  sink  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  better than  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  came so late as if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  left to catch the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  we were going to consume. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  then forgot to put in one of our  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and apologized in the most stand offish way possible saying  <START:Food> it <END>  was a "human error" as if  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  wasn't even sorry about  <START:Food> it <END> . As we received the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> , my friend realized  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  got spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  when  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  had wanted  <START:F_FoodItem> yellowtail <END> . All in all worst  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  ever! The only  <START:Service> decent <END>   <START:S_Staff> person <END>  was the busboy. Avoid the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  with a feather tattoo behind  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  ear.
We had a great  <START:Service> work <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were about 20 of us and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  did a great job timing the courses.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was nothing extraordinary.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the New York  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  could've used a little more  <START:F_Ingredients> marbling <END> .   The  <START:F_FoodItem> cornbread <END>  we got before the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was the best thing I ate the whole night.  One annoying thing at this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  was so  <START:F_FI_Quality> hard <END> /cold you couldn't use  <START:Food> it <END>  on the  <START:F_Drinks> soft <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  Get with  <START:Food> it <END> .
This is a  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END>  local  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  is quick and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> .   <START:Food> it <END> 's a good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  when you want Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  but want a step up from fast  <START:Food> food <END>  or casual quick.  I will say, however, on both of my visits, my  <START:Food> meal <END>  was good but arrived at my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  barely  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> warm <END> .  Would have been better had my  <START:Food> meals <END>  been  <START:Service> served <END>  hot.   <START:Food> dinner <END>  for 2 including  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:Service> tip <END>  was just over $40.00.
Very good  <START:Food> food <END> . We are  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> . And both of us  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>   <START:Food> entree <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  curry and  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  tandoori.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are fantastic. But I don't like the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are too sweet for me.
So, i went to see Javier Colon in  <START:A_Entertainment> concert <END>  on Tuesday night....which i had been  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for an opportunity to see him perform  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> live <END>  since 2004, so i was stoked about going. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:O_Reservation> tickets <END> , which were  <START:O_Reservation> front row <END>  btw, at a  <START:Service> decent <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  for  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>   <START:O_Reservation> reserved <END> ...not bad for $38 per  <START:O_Reservation> ticket <END>  i thought. I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  a week and a half for my  <START:O_Reservation> tickets <END>  to make their journey through the mail, but still nothing, even on the day of the  <START:A_Entertainment> concert <END> , nada! I called and was told  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  would be  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  at will call for me, so i  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  up after struggling to find a  <START:S_Seating> sitter <END>  for my daughter and the  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  drive from Queen Creek, only to just be escorted to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END> , no  <START:O_Reservation> ticket <END>  stub for a keepsake or  <START:Food> anything <END> (AWESOME #1....not). We get to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and not only are the  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  i  <START:O_Reservation> reserved <END>  not empty, but apparently  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  thought i'd be cool with letting someone else  <START:S_Seating> sit <END>  in one of our  <START:O_Reservation> reserved <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  and myself or my wife just slide over one. Well,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  would have been cool if i wanted my head right next to a PA system, and to krank my neck up like i was talking to Shaq for 3 hours, but not only do i like my hearing, but i also have a bulging disc in my neck....(AWESOME #2!). When we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> ,  <START:Food> it <END>  took roughly 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  before a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  came to speak with us even to ask us if we wanted a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  or  <START:S_Menu> menus <END> ...sure why not....my wife and i decide  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we will each get one  <START:Food> item <END> , i was gonna get a  <START:F_Drinks> beverage <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was getting a  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END> , since we had just eaten  <START:Food> dinner <END>  while on the way to the  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> . About 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> later <END> , a different  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  approached us, we gave our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ...only to be told  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we must both  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  2  <START:Food> items <END>  minimum, otherwise  <START:Food> it <END>  will be an additional $10 per  <START:S_Staff> person <END> (Awesome #3) I'm pretty sure i  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  for my  <START:A_Entertainment> concert <END>   <START:O_Reservation> ticket <END> , not a  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> ...thanks though, not so much!We finally just got fed up so  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we told the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  we were not going to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  any  <START:Food> item <END> , only to be told, rudely i might add,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  states such on the  <START:O_Reservation> ticket <END>  stub(which once again we hadn't received). Obviously not an issue i could help  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  with, especially seeing as how their was barely even walking  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for anyone over 95 lbs. Crowded is a good thing for a  <START:A_Entertainment> concert <END> , but do you really want the assortment of  <START:Food> food <END>  smells and  <START:F_Drinks> liquors <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  with the other customers bad breath as the scent of a date night. ( <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's #4!)After the  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  was over, right as we were in the process of getting up from our  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  to make our way to the  <START:A_Fur_Door> door <END> , our original  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  approaches us, immediately apologizing for the other  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> actions <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> tone <END> . We stated  <START:Food> it <END>  was fine but we will definitely never be going back. For being nice, so to speak...i'd rather stick to real venues... <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  actually are about  <START:Service> service <END> , not  <START:F_FI_Price> dollars <END> ...one thing i have learned in my life... <START:Service> treat <END>  people right, be  <START:Service> treated <END>  right....No  <START:Service> tip <END>  FOR YOU!.
I have heard so much about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , so I finally tried ifor my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  did not  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> live <END>  up to the hype  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was built.  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:Service> decent <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Service> decent <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , but not  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> ....$12.99 for a half rotisierre  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . Frys gives you a whole one for $5.99 and  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  the same. I guess I was  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for the  <START:Food> dish <END>  soap used to wash the LARGE  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> ...so large,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was so much  <START:A_Places> space <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> them <END> . Just saying, if I am going to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>   <START:O_Payment> charged <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> , I expected MUCH better. I still may go, if someone can convince me I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the wrong  <START:Food> item <END> .
 <START:Food> it <END> 's fine.  No, really,  <START:Food> it <END> 's fine.Seriously,  <START:Food> it <END> 's fine.I'm not being sarcastic,  <START:Food> it <END> 's fine.__________________________________(this is just for the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END> , which I've had 10-15  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  since I usually stay  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  when I come to Pittsburgh)
Day after thanksgiving me and my buddy thought we would have  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  at Chompies. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was crowded but we got  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  right away. At first glance  <START:Food> it <END>  looked like any other major deli, but after seeing the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  I saw  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have a different kind of  <START:S_Menu> selection <END> . Wanting to try a something new I went for the famous "Original Jewish sliders" as featured on Man vs  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are 2 pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> challah <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> latka <END>  and and  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END> , topped with  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .   <START:Food> it <END>  was great, and  <START:Food> it <END>  was super filling. I don't know how  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  had 11 of  <START:S_Staff> them <END> . I was full after 3.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are packed and rich with  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> . My friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Spanish  <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END> , and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said  <START:Food> it <END>  wasn't very good, but  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  finished  <START:Food> it <END>  cause  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was hungry. Overall I would have to try more  <START:F_FoodItem> stuff <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  to really judge this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was pretty good, and  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> , but a lot of the  <START:Food> food <END>  just looks average.
 <START:Food> food <END>  is delicious. I had the Vegenini,  <START:Food> it <END>  is like a  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . I loved  <START:Food> it <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:Food> fries <END>  are also delicious. Customer  <START:Service> service <END>  is always  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> .
Brian and his  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are very  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> .  The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and other  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are fantastic.  I highly recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> carpaccio <END> ,  <START:Food> it <END> 's AMAZING.
While not inedible, I don't think the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavors <END>  were at all authentic. We tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  curry,  <START:F_FoodItem> eggplant <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  korma and tandoori  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . Of these, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tandoori and v. Korma were best. The  <START:F_FoodItem> nan <END>  was  <START:Service> decent <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END> , even at medium, is not at all spicy.
We had the best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  is awesome.  However, the  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  was way too salty.   <START:Food> it <END>  was so salty  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  ruined a good piece of good  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> .  We should have taken  <START:Food> it <END>  back, but we were too tired  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we wanted to go back to our  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> broccolini <END>  was plain and the mash  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  was just ok.
Went to this  <START:Restaurant> spot <END>  because  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to the Putt Park. Sadly Putt Park was a huge let down, but thankfully the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was YUMMY!We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a little bit of  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was great. We were pretty much the only  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  which can lead to  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  being all over you or nowhere in sight but not our  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  :) I will definitely go back.
We only went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  because we had a  <START:S_Gift> gift certificate <END> . The caesar  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  had been sitting in  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END>  too  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  and was wilted, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> croutons <END>  were so  <START:F_FI_Quality> hard <END>  I nearly broke a tooth! My daughter, who is 13, said  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  basic alfredo  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was "disgusting", and I have to admit  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  was pretty gross, swimming in  <START:F_Drinks> milk <END>  and completely lacking any  <START:F_Ingredients> seasonning <END> . My husband's  <START:F_Drinks> tequila <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was very bland. But my  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> , surprisingly, were very good! The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is all over the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ... <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ? Lebanese? American/? Mexican? We don't know! WIll we go back? Probably not.
my husband and I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> oeufs fameux <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> fromage <END>  and  Benedict montreal smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are quite good.  Better than the same  <START:Food> food <END>  in other  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .If I have to say what are not perfect on our  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  are the  <START:F_FoodItem> patates rissolees <END>  and the Hollandais  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .The tates of the ppotatos are good and  <START:Offers> special <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> rosemary <END>  and some kind of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .  But  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are  too much minced.  I think  <START:Food> it <END> 's because  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> over-boiled <END> .  And we figure out  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  might make the Hollandais  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  by themselves, the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is way too rich, you will feel very stuffed after eating two Benedict  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> .And I'm  <START:O_Experience> surprised <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:O_Payment> charged <END>  for the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  which other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  seem don't do. We  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $35  <START:O_Payment> tax <END>  included for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> .    <START:Food> it <END> 's an enjoyable  <START:Food> meal <END>  anyhow.  We will go back again.
Would give  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  but  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's not fair as I'm a  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>  now... So this review is solely based on the  <START:Food> fries <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a small  <START:F_FoodItem> fry <END>  to go and noticed  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  scooped the  <START:Food> fries <END>  out of a metal  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  wasn't even being heated.. The  <START:Food> fries <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END>  and barely  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> warm <END> . I requested  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  said  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  didn't offer  <START:Food> it <END>  except for with  <START:F_FoodItem> poutine <END> ?!?!  But I don't really eat  <START:F_FoodItem> dairy <END>  so I just wanted  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  and would  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  extra.. Nope  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  refused to sell me  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END> . I only had a few  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  as the  <START:Food> fries <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END>  and then when I got home (TMI sorry) I rushed to the  <START:F_FI_Healthy> bathroom <END> . I guess my system rejected this  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END> .PS- no A/C during 33 degree weather.Gave an extra  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  as I'm a  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>   <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>  eater and feel somewhat biased reviewing a fast  <START:Food> food <END>  joint.
 <START:Food> it <END> 's a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and very customer- <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> . I loved the  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END>  separation in the same pot (caters to different  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END> : check). You are immersed in vapors and you come out feeling very full. I enjoyed almost  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  I put on my  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> , but when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is crowded the  <START:Food> food <END>  can get  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  up on the shelves. I really like  <START:Food> it <END> .
I have been coming to Casanova Brothers for about 2 years and I can honestly say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I've never had less than an exceptional  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  remember your name, ask about your  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> , and genuinely  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  about each customer's  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . The Sicilian  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is great, thick but never  <START:Food> doughy <END> , and  <START:Food> crunchy <END>  with the perfect amount of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . However, the white  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is what keeps me coming back! You can  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  by the slice or get the whole  <START:F_FoodItem> pie <END> , and my staple  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  on the white  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  are  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> . A must try!  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is  <START:A_Environment> inviting <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are excellent. If you are a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  snob, you will find no better  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  around!
The best Ive had in a  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> !  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:Service> treated <END>  us like  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was wonderful. Finally a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  w/ island style  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  and  <START:S_Menu> recipes <END> ! I will be using the  <START:Service> service <END>  I just received as a model for the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I manage. Thanks Island  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> 
Great  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END>  with great  <START:Service> service <END> ! Always happy with the  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END> . Keep up the good  <START:Service> work <END> !!
Awesome  <START:Service> service <END> . Awesome  <START:Food> meal <END> . Lobster Pot  <START:F_FoodItem> pie <END>  still the best  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  ever, but should be shared. If you like Kale, the Kale Caesar  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  is Unbelievable
being korean i've learned  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  i cannot go a few days without eating korean  <START:Food> food <END>  i really don't know why, but  <START:Food> it <END> 's something  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  i have to have within days. so i realized ginseng 3 opened about 6 months ago and my mom and i decided to go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:A_Environment> new years eve <END> . we had the mandu duk guk (dumpling  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ) because  <START:Food> it <END> 's  <START:F_FI_Religious> tradition <END>  to eat  <START:Food> it <END>  on new years ( <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  life or good luck...idk something like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> ) and  <START:Food> it <END>  was good!!! i'm only giving  <START:Food> it <END>  a 4 because i haven't had  <START:Food> anything <END>  else  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , but i will definitely update next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  i go back :)
Gotta say I was  <START:O_Experience> surprised <END>  at this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ...I maybe a frequent customer. <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END>  rub the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  then add a  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  based  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  on top of  <START:Food> it <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was just about falling off the  <START:F_FoodItem> bone <END>  and good. The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> , frankly I gotta try  <START:Food> it <END>  again.  <START:Food> it <END>  was good I just couldn't get a feel for  <START:Food> it <END> . Not spicy, a little sweet with smokyI also got a pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , yes I did get a half a rack and a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , what, big man gotta eat!  The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  where good I tried eat one. The  <START:F_Ingredients> mustard <END>  based one had a kick to  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I'm gonna venture and try again.I asked about the  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  don't keep  <START:Food> it <END>  on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  just for the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> .Only bad part was how the  <START:Service> served <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  beard in  <START:S_Cutlery> aluminum foil <END>  for some reason  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  reminded me of school  <START:Food> lunch <END>  back in the day. I ate  <START:Food> it <END>  though!I'll be back at the Rock Store and we'll update when I've got a clearer  <START:A_Decor> picture <END> . A solid 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  on the Que for now.
my bf made  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  a month or so back for our valentines day  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ..since we had a great  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at our anniversary  <START:Food> dinner <END>  (read my other review for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> !)we were standing at  <START:A_Places> podium <END>  for a good 10mins b/c  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was noone  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ...so i eyed someone in the  <START:Restaurant> resturant <END>  to have  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  someone come over to help us...we  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for 5mins in their lil  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>   <START:A_Places> area <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> ...and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was great but as amazing as  <START:Food> it <END>  was last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  though. we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , i  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  hot sour  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  since  <START:Food> it <END>  is def yummy, and we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tenderloin <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> shredded pro <END>  and shared both  <START:Food> dishes <END> ...boy! we were full!  <START:Food> it <END>  was delicious and i recieved a rose since  <START:Food> it <END>  was vday :) so  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was a great gesture!my bf and i would come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  yet again..since its prob the only few  <START:Restaurant> resturants <END>  we would drop  <START:O_Pay_Price> money <END>  for  <START:Food> food <END>  on...of  <START:S_Menu> course <END>  for a  <START:Offers> special <END>  occasion though aha
"Never judge a book by its cover". This is one of  <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>  small  <START:A_Places> gems <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  people might not give a 2nd look.  <START:Food> it <END> 's a free standing  <START:Ambience> building <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  has had its share of  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  tenants. If a buddy hadn't told me about Luu's, I might never have spotted  <START:Food> it <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  fresh, and  <START:Food> it <END>  is GOOD!  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  are my favorites. Very casual, fast  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> , but definitely dine-in  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . Tam and Christy are very  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a convenient drive-thru, also. CHECK  <START:Food> it <END>  OUT!
1  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  of  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  should be enough for 4 small people or 2 large people
Sooo, my rating isn't really regarding the  <START:Food> food <END> . I've been twice-  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  until after the 2nd  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to Yelp to give  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  a fair chance but really wanted to share my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  to possibly save somebody else from the hassle.... Both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  weren't amazing but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  certainly weren't terrible either. My biggest  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  is with the  <START:Service> service <END> . BOTH  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  we had suuuuuuuper slow  <START:S_Staff> servers <END> . Both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  screwed up at least 2  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> .  The first  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  gave us the wrong  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , I'm a good patron, I totally expect  <START:F_FoodItem> stuff <END>  happens and I usually give the benefit of the doubt. Well-  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  AGAIN brought the wrong thing. How does one manage to do  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> !?We decided to give  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  another try since  <START:Food> it <END> 's the closer BWW to us and we were totally craving  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> . Well?  <START:Food> it <END>  was way worse this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .   <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  was the same- pretty good.   <START:Service> service <END> ? Sucky.   <START:Food> it <END>  was really odd because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  seemed to be an over abundance of  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  scheduled this particular night and yet the  <START:Service> service <END>  was super slow.  When the  <START:S_Staff> girl <END>  finally came to take our  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> , I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> soft <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and my boyfriend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .  So  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  comes back and does get my  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  right, but brings him a completely different  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .  I try to flag  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  down as  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  leaves without even asking if we were good and tell  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END> 's given us the wrong  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> . "Oooops! I'll be back!" No lie- at least 5  <START:S_Del_Time> mins <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> later <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  finally  <START:A_Entertainment> shows <END>  up with the correct one.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  arrived and this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were no hiccups with the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , so we were just trying to enjoy the  <START:Food> meal <END> . So again I had to flag  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  down for a refill on my  <START:F_Drinks> beverage <END>  and again for the check since we wanted to catch a  <START:A_Entertainment> movie <END> .The check  <START:A_Entertainment> shows <END>  up and I always look to make sure  <START:Food> things <END>  are ok (especially when I can tell the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  is a ditz) and sure enough-  <START:S_Staff> she <END>   <START:O_Payment> charged <END>  us for the incorrect  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  AND the one  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  originally  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and got eventually.  I flag  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  down again and tell  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  about  <START:Food> it <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> apologizes <END>  and says  <START:S_Staff> she <END> 'll fix  <START:Food> it <END> .At this point, my boyfriend had given  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  the  <START:O_Pay_Method> card <END>  to  <START:O_Payment> charge <END>  after  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  had fixed the tab. I warned him against  <START:Food> it <END>  because the  <START:S_Staff> girl <END>  was dumb as rocks, but let the inevitable happen. <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> later <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  appears and says  <START:S_Staff> she <END> 's having trouble figuring out how to remove the  <START:O_Payment> charge <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  had  <START:O_Payment> charged <END>  the  <START:O_Pay_Method> card <END>  before  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  changed the total. Awesome.So now the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  had to come and fix the whole mess and we were FINALLY on our way.We both decided  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we'd  <START:O_Experience> never come back <END>  to this particular  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  and try the Gilbert  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  off Gilbert.
I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  is so nice and professional. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is awesome,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have a great  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  and their  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are even better.
No lengthy review needed....great  <START:Service> service <END> , perfect (and honest)  <START:S_Menu> suggestions <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , and delicious  <START:Food> food <END> . Won't be our last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
In  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of priority given the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and I was not nearly as hungry as my partner in crime:5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  -  <START:A_Places> space <END> ,  <START:A_Decor> layout <END> ,  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  goes on for miles, and the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathrooms <END>  are sweet..yeah, I said  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .. 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  - the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is great, the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , a downright treat4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  - the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  ware is out of this world...where did you get  <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> cups <END> , I want one...2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  - the  <START:Service> service <END> , we  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  a good 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for a... <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for  <START:Food> it <END> ...a single  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  with a few  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  at 9:30 in the am on a Saturday...the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was empty with the exception of a few  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  dwellers and a crazy amount of  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> .So, RnR you are really really pretty but I can't bring you home to mom and dad because well, like you are not real stable if you know what I mean, but I will  <START:A_Env_Type> party <END>  with you any day!
Super  <START:Service> service <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent, you must try the Swedish  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END> . I really enjoyed Mike and Fletcher, a wealth of knowledge. This is a must stop in  <START:Restaurant> plaza <END>  Midwood.
What a disappointment!I was starving when I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> smoothie <END>  plus boba, and a  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  Club on a  <START:F_FoodItem> croissant <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>  and extra  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> , then tipped the  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END> .  I love  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  and boba, so I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  with high anticipation for a fresh, delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on par with the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  Lee's popularity suggests.  Imagine my dismay when I instead got a stale, old, tough  <START:F_FoodItem> croissant <END>  with pre-squished  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END> , a minimal amount of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> , and WAYYYYYY too much  <START:F_Ingredients> mayonnaise <END> !Don't bother with the boba either,  <START:Food> it <END> 's really  <START:F_FI_Quality> hard <END>  and not fresh.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> smoothies <END>  don't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like real fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  either, even though  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  say  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are. Funny, I didn't know  <START:F_FoodItem> jackfruit <END>  could be shipped to Nevada without being frozen. -_-;;  The  <START:F_FoodItem> smoothie <END>  I got didn't even  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like frozen  <START:F_FoodItem> jackfruit <END> ...  <START:Food> it <END>  tasted like a premade  <START:F_Ingredients> flavoring <END>  added to a  <START:F_Ingredients> mix <END> .I should also mention  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  was fairly rude while I was  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END> , like I was an inconvenience to  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  in showing up and politely expecting  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  to do  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  job for a  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  and a half. I was so hungry when I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I would have accepted even Subway as passible  <START:Food> food <END> .  For me to feel this badly about what  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  offered is a pretty abysmal first  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .  Due to such a stark lack of redeemable  <START:F_FI_Quality> qualities <END>  I won't be returning... not even at 2 in the morning, not even if every other  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is closed... I'd rather go to a fast  <START:Food> food <END>  joint, eat a Cliff  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , or starve.
I've studied and had my share of great and authentic Japanese  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> -- <START:Food> it <END> 's as much an  <START:A_Decor> art <END>  as a science.Not bad. Girls are really nice  <START:Restaurant> here <END> --aiming to please.  The  <START:A_Places> space <END>  is clean. <START:Food> it <END>  was great to see  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have the popular dual  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END>  (tonkotsu-shoyu)  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is quite trendy in Japan.   <START:Food> it <END>  was excellent. Unfortunately the  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  are not made  <START:Restaurant> here <END> --what a disappointment.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  was made too far in advance and thus cold and too  <START:F_FI_Quality> hard <END> .But I didn't expect  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  much out  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in Vegas, so  <START:Food> it <END>  was a nice  <START:Food> meal <END>  despite the  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> .
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has been on my radar for three months now. I finally made  <START:Food> it <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  a few days ago, and I have to say - <START:Food> it <END>  was a disappointing  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .  I chose  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Food> item <END>  F-6 (Spicy Thai Holy  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ) -which was stir fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> , and Thai holy  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  leaves. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  itself was sliced -not ground and was a little tough and  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END> . The  <START:Food> dish <END>  appeared to be swimming in  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END>  -instead of a  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I didn't know sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  could be greasy... The level 3  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  out of 5 barely registered as spicy, and as a result the  <START:Food> food <END>  was bland. Why do most Thai  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  skimp on  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END> ? I thought this was a  <START:Food> dish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  featured  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END> ?  Instead, I found myself on the hunt looking for  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  underneath the rubbery overcooked  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  itself is clean, quaint, and  <START:A_Environment> inviting <END> . My  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  was done in 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  which was nice considering I was on my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  break. However, I would rather  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  took their  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to make sure the  <START:Food> dish <END>  actually tasted good. I won't come back as  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are just too many good Thai  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  to choose from in Las Vegas.
I've been to The House at Secret Garden a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  for private events. The  <START:A_Places> area <END>  is absolutely gorgeous but their  <START:Food> food <END>  &  <START:Service> service <END>  is just mediocre. One event I went to was in the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  & sun  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> , and the other was in the urban barn. The  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  was very nice but the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  is a standard plain white  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> .  The urban barn is cute from the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  but the inside is a little janky. The  <START:Ambience> ceiling <END>  and  <START:Ambience> beams <END>  are unfinished ugly wood with the manufacturer stamps still visible and spray  <START:A_Decor> painting <END> ... <START:Restaurant> they <END>  could have at least stained  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  a neutral brown.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are  <START:A_Decor> faux <END>  wooden  <START:Ambience> beams <END>   <START:A_Decor> painting <END>  on the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END> . Not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  impressive, but the  <START:A_Places> area <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  (we had  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  under the carob tree) is beautiful.The  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  is a different story. One of the  <START:Food> meals <END>  was catered by Santa Barabara catering and  <START:Food> it <END>  was fantastic. If you're hosting an event  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , I recommend going with a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  from the catering company. The other  <START:Food> meal <END>  was a  <START:S_Seating> sit <END>  down, pre-selected 3  <START:S_Menu> course <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END> . The  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> / <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  had zero coordination. One  <START:S_Staff> person <END>  out of the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  would get their hot  <START:Food> entree <END>  a good 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  before anyone else got theirs.  <START:Food> it <END>  was near impossible to get  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  and was impossible to get a refill of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . I thought the  <START:Food> food <END>  was disappointing. I had:-  <START:F_FoodItem> goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> beet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> : By far the best thing I had. Great  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END> , yummy  <START:F_FoodItem> goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> greens <END> . -  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>  Trio: So small and just okay. The  <START:F_FoodItem> grilled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> eggplant <END>  was very soggy and the  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  jam  <START:Food> it <END>  was topped with was far too sweet for an  <START:Food> entree <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> arancini ball <END>  was delicious but I only got one...for my  <START:Food> entree <END> . If  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  had been 3 then  <START:Food> it <END>  would have been a  <START:Food> meal <END> .-  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  with Fudge, Fleur De Sel  <START:F_FoodItem> caramel <END> , & Buttercream  <START:F_FoodItem> frosting <END> : Amazing sounding description but one of the worst  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  I've ever had. The  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  was so  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END>  and barely had a  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was about a tablespoon's  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> frosting <END>  and not even a teaspoon of  <START:F_FoodItem> caramel <END> . So so  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END>  and lacking the richness or  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  of a  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .-  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  Pudding: Much better than the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  but still average.If you're planning on hosting an event at The House at Secret Garden, I recommend trying to make  <START:Food> it <END>  as outdoors as possible (prettiest) and not using their in house catering.
We walked in to Le Comptoir without a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END> , and we got a great  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  at the  <START:A_Places> counter <END> , where we could watch all of the hipster-esque  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cook <END>  beautiful  <START:Food> dishes <END>  all night  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END> . We watched  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  send out  <START:Food> dish <END>  after  <START:Food> dish <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  looked -- and, more importantly, tasted -- delicious. We did not  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> charcuterie <END> , which was probably a mistake, but we did have the  <START:F_FoodItem> beet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> braised <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  loin,  <START:F_FoodItem> porchetta <END> , and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ceviche <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ceviche <END>  was probably our least favorite, but we still enjoyed  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  also had a great  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list with lots of approachable  <START:F_Drinks> wines <END>  by the  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END> , and very knowledgeable  <START:S_Staff> waitstaff <END> . A great  <START:Food> dining <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  all around.
For my fiancee's first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  in Vegas  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  insisted on doing a  <START:Food> buffet <END> . Since I was going to be forced into going to one I decided to pick one of the  <START:Service> decent <END>  ones and Wicked Spoon was my first  <START:S_Menu> choice <END> . Really  <START:Food> it <END>  wasn't bad (for  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ), but  <START:Food> it <END>  wasn't great either.I sampled the  <START:F_FoodItem> paella <END>  and  <START:Food> it <END>  was actually ok (for  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ), and the  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was an interesting addition and not bad (for  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ), and some of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END>  were enjoyable (for  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ), and the overall  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was pretty good (for  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ).Really though, a lot of  <START:Food> food <END>  didn't  <START:Service> work <END>  in the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  format.  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END>  in small  <START:Food> dishes <END>  didn't really seem to  <START:S_Seating> sit <END>  well,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> curries <END>  also seemed to suffer. Actually  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  unique about this  <START:Food> buffet <END>  seemed to suffer sitting in the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  format, and the small  <START:Food> dishes <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  and your small  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  seemed to want to force you into multiple trips back to the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  until you just can't be bothered anymore and leave. The good  <START:Food> things <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  are the  <START:Food> things <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you see in other (cheaper)  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END> . A pile of  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs on your  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> , a gigantic heap of mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> , just about  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  from a big communal trough worked (for  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ).  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  was uneven and the  <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END>  left a bad  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in my mouth. A greyhound is like $8 (since I guess  <START:Food> it <END>  fits their spirit+mixer format), but a salty  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  which is a greyhound with a  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  rim is somehow 2 or 4  <START:F_FI_Price> dollars <END>  more?  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's some expensive  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> .So really what  <START:Food> it <END>  comes down to is if the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is good is the  <START:F_FoodItem> stuff <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you can get in a  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  format works, and the  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> stuff <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is all kind of mediocre and suffers for sitting in the  <START:A_Decor> heatlamps <END> , what's the point of coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ? I can't really find one.  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  being said, if you have someone who really wants to go to a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  and you don't want the usual  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , then this one is ok (for  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ).Edit: My fiancée just informed me the salty  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  was 14  <START:F_FI_Price> dollars <END> (!). I'm never one to complain about  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  can't be any rationale behind  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  other than "You're in Vegas, fuck you."
I took the whole  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  on a Sunday afternoon and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was about a 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to  <START:S_Seating> sit <END>  down.  Figured  <START:Food> it <END>  was a good thing  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we were not the only ones  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  were good and the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was super  <START:A_Env_Type> busy <END>  but still took good  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  of us.  We all  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  some form of  <START:F_FoodItem> chimichanga <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were all good.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  messed up my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and brought me  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  instead of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  which was ok because the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  had a little kick to  <START:Food> it <END> .  The kids had minichimis  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had no complaints.  We will definateley be going back.  Maybe next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we will take advantage of happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> .
The  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is great.I love  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  Just  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> , a locally roasted fair trade, organic  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is  <START:S_Delivery> delivered <END>  by bicycle.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  use organic and locally  <START:F_Ingredients> sourced <END>  products for their other  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  as well.Nice  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , with an open air  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  on the east side in the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> warm <END>  months.The  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  for  <START:Service> service <END>  can be  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  move quickly and the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  is never very  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END> .The  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  seem reasonable for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  - the old "you get what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for" matra!
Love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is amazing,  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is really nice, and the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  (Luke) is fantastic.  My friends and I come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  often and we love  <START:Food> it <END> .
Yummy  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> , great  <START:A_Entertainment> entertainment <END> , welcoming  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  and good  <START:Service> service <END> 
Periodically I go in search of a good local  <START:Food> diner <END>  for just a good  <START:Food> meal <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is the perfect  <START:A_LocatedArea> small town <END>   <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> .  <START:Food> it <END> 's not  <START:A_Decor> fancy <END> , the  <START:A_Furniture> chairs <END>  don't match  <START:Food> it <END> 's just a simple  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  and I love  <START:Food> it <END> ! The  <START:Food> food <END>  is great,  <START:Service> service <END>  is quick and  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  is good! I will be bringing my friends and  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  from out of town after a night of too much fun.
We just came back from this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  tonight. We really enjoyed our  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at this tiny Ethiopian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was full of flavour.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  offered extra Injera for no extra  <START:O_Payment> charge <END> . We had the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  combo and a  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  which turned out to be a little too much  <START:Food> food <END>  for us- we are stuffed right now! And the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END> , $31 including  <START:O_Payment> tax <END> !  <START:Food> it <END>  was really reasonable for the huge  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  we got. The 2  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were so nice.  <START:Food> food <END>  came out fast and we were impressed with the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> it <END> . We will be back!Disclaimers and other notes:  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is basic, but  <START:Food> it <END>  seems like  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> . We would have taken  <START:Food> it <END> , but  <START:Food> it <END> 's too cold tonight.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  did not really have  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:S_Menu> options <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END> , so you may want to opt to plan  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> /sweets into your evening  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> main <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> . This is not  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  poeple eat with  <START:S_Cutlery> utensils <END> - A lady near our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  suggested many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  to the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  MUST get  <START:S_Cutlery> forks <END> . And when  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  tried to explain his cultural  <START:F_FI_Religious> tradition <END> .  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was all: Ya, but you really need  <START:S_Cutlery> forks <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was kind of hilarious. Enjoy!
This brewery is pretty dope. I like the IPA's but I'd stay away from  <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> . Good  <START:Service> service <END> , looks more like a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Overall a good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to chill and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .
The best Soul  <START:Food> food <END>  hands down! I got the fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  wi th  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  n  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  n  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .....  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  kill  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> 
Best Rueben in town! I take my ruebens seriously, i judge a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  on  <START:Food> it <END> . If you mess up a rueben you're dead to me. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was great and I liked the overall feel of the  <START:Ambience> establishment <END> .
Wow! We had the Hell's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  & Sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:Food> fries <END> , American  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  & Truffle  <START:Food> fries <END> .  If you eat nothing else for the  <START:F_FoodItem> rest <END>  of your life make  <START:Food> it <END>  the Sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:Food> fries <END> .
Had high expectations from all the great reviews from Yelp. I know  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>   <START:Restaurant> places <END>  tend to be salty (though I've eaten at a few  <START:Restaurant> places <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  weren't), and this was no exception.  If the  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was flavorful, I couldn't really tell because the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  content drowned out all the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  base and my gf had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  base. Both were equally salty. I even added a  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of hot  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  to my  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:Food> it <END>  was still salty.. Ugggh!  And the two slices of  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  I got in my  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was literally more fat than  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .  And now I'm feeling so thirsty..  Definitely not one of the better  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> .   I will not be returning.
The best  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  in Phoenix!!!
Customer  <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are always excellent. Every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we visit Las Vegas we make  <START:Food> it <END>  a point to have  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . We recommend  <START:Food> it <END>  to  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  visits Las Vegas. My husband is very picky when  <START:Food> it <END>  comes to  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  always walks out raving about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  so I know  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are doing  <START:Food> things <END>  right  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is so good  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  signed up for a Yelp account so  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  personally can give  <START:Food> it <END>  5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  (very unlike him).
I was really looking forward to eating at this  <START:Food> food <END>  truck, but after eating their stir  <START:F_FoodItem> fry <END> , I would have to agree with the other reviewers -its not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  great.   <START:A_Places> portion <END>  was a good size but  <START:Food> it <END>  was pretty bland and needed more  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  Unfortunately, won't be visiting this  <START:Food> food <END>  truck again.
Went back today with the whole  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> ....I have to suggest the  <START:F_FoodItem> al pastor vampiro <END> !   <START:Food> it <END> 's like a  <START:F_FoodItem> tostada <END> , but so much better!  The  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>   <START:Food> tortilla <END>  isn't fried, but  <START:Food> it <END>  is crisp, light and not greasy.  A great option for  <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>  who like crunch.  My dad had the  <START:F_FoodItem> carne asada torta <END>  and was really happy.   <START:S_Staff> he <END> 's not a big fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> tortillas <END> , so the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was the perfect  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  for him.   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  thought this was a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are so many different  <START:S_Menu> options <END> .  Definitely go for the carne asada or al pastor on  <START:Food> anything <END> !
 <START:Food> it <END>  was alright. Nothing  <START:Offers> special <END> . Pretty average.  <START:Food> food <END>  arrived lukewarm, had to heat  <START:Food> it <END>  up for a bit. Way too much  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> teriyaki <END>   <START:Food> entree <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was very good  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  though.
 <START:Food> it <END>  had probably been twenty years since I had tried any  <START:F_FoodItem> hotdogs <END>  on a stick and now I remember why.  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  three  <START:F_FoodItem> hotdogs <END>  on a  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END> , one on a stick,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tenders and two  <START:F_Drinks> lemonades <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came to OVER $30.  Okay.Let me start by saying I've never felt more ripped off in my life.  Tiny shriveled  <START:F_FoodItem> hotdogs <END>  and third-rate  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> .  I mean seriously, if the  <START:F_FoodItem> hotdogs <END>  were $0.99 instead of $3.85 I might not be writing this...but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  weren't.  Likewise, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was thickly  <START:F_FoodItem> breaded <END>  and looked like  <START:Food> it <END>  had been deep fried some weeks ago and merely heated up...in fact, I'm nearly sure  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is how  <START:Food> it <END>  was.  The actual " <START:F_FoodItem> hotdog <END>  on a stick" we got, according to my wife, was fine.I will give  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  high marks on their fine  <START:F_Drinks> lemonades <END> .   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were tasty and great.In short, I would have to be starving and this be literally the last  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  on earth before I'd go back.   <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  bad...and a horrific value proposition, especially when you consider the excellent Costco  <START:F_FoodItem> hotdogs <END>  just a few miles away.I predict this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  will  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  down within less than a year -  <START:Food> it <END>  is a weird  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  with a weird drive-thru and inadequate signage.
A great addition to this  <START:A_Places> area <END> . The  <START:Food> dining <END>  and  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  areas were nice and well kept. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were extremely helpful and  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> . I love  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I can  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  my  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> protein <END> , or green style as  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  called  <START:Food> it <END> . Their  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  custard was heavenly! We will go back.I wish  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:Food> fries <END> !
Best  <START:F_FoodItem> gyros <END>  in the world customer  <START:Service> service <END>  is great I would really recommend ALS Chicago Finest  <START:F_FoodItem> gyros <END> !!!!! Good  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  and yummy
 <START:Food> food <END>  was mediocre at best, and overpriced. Rotating  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  on  <START:S_Cutlery> cask <END>  is a great idea, but half a pint for the pint  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  just seems wrong.  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was nice,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were only for other  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  while we were  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . Can't see making a return visit.
Pulling up to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  the 1st good indicator, lotsa Indians  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  with obvious full & happy bellies. The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  could've been any  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Nothing Indian abou  <START:Food> it <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's fine.  <START:Food> it <END>  was clean & didn't smell like sweaty feet.The  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is just a few tems & I tasted  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  all. Very good! The  <START:F_FoodItem> nan <END>  was great & plentiful & the  <START:Service> service <END>  efficient.  BUT the draw if this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> it <END> 's really inexpensive...$7. I'll keep this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in mind at the end of the month & needing to rob the coin jar.
Love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  is tucked in a small  <START:Restaurant> plaza <END>  off the  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END>  in Chinatown. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great and the lady who took our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  was incredibly  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  is interesting to see the 3 different  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  base  <START:F_FoodItem> ramens <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  offered. This was how each  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  was described to us by the waitressKome  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  (Hokkaido style) - their best selling flavorShiro  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  (Kyoto Style) - very similar to your regular  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  soupRight side is Mame  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  (Nagoya Style) - "bold" flavorSoup was flavorful and filling.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have a monthly  <START:Offers> special <END>  and this month's was free  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  add-on. The other add-ons were additional  <START:O_Payment> charge <END>  (like  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> ), but  <START:Food> it <END> 's not a big deal for me.At the end of our  <START:Food> meal <END> , we were offered free lychee  <START:F_Dessert> ice cream <END>  and stamp cards. If i lived closer to Vegas, I would definitely come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again.
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  rocks!  Found this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  on Yelp coz I was craving for Asian  <START:Food> food <END>  and my white business partner was craving for  <START:F_FI_Quality> hard <END>   <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END> .  Great happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END> ,  <START:Food> food <END>  is great and the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are legit.   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is the bomb and the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  really is upbeat.   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is really  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> .  This is a new go-to  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for me.
Last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went, we were given poor banchan while the two  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  next to us received much higher  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  banchan (?) We got  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  and some  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END> , while  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> , kimch radish,  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts, etc. Why???? Also kept hearing the lady in the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  "found the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> " after overhearing the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  tell the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  next to us  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were out of spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> . How do you lose the  <START:Food> food <END>  in your  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> ?! I had apparently  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the last  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  for spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , but I was extremely  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END>  and overcooked.The  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are also a bit unreasonable. The nengmyn-kalbi combo comes with a good  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  but literally 4 pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . Probably won't be returning  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for a while.
I love  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and Go. The delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and nice  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  make my day.  Eating  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is making me more  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END> .    <START:Food> it <END> 's a very convenient drive through with  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> .   <START:Food> it <END> 's clean and the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  about us.  The  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  was patient with me when I asked about organics.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  large filling  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  for an inexpensive  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> .As a single  <START:S_Staff> person <END>  who has fresh  <START:Food> food <END>  spoil in the  <START:A_Furniture> refrigerator <END> , I would like to divert my whole grocery budget to  <START:S_Staff> them <END> .
Mean  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , as usual.  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in the new Forum  <START:Food> food <END>  Court at Caesars Palace. I grab Earl of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I go to Vegas so I was excited to see another one open. My  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  was shopping at the Forum  <START:Restaurant> shops <END>  and needed a quick  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . We decided to eat at the  <START:Food> food <END>  court we passed by on our way to the  <START:Restaurant> shops <END> . Little did I know  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the Forum  <START:Food> food <END>  Court opened  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  very day.I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  an  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>  BLT on  <START:F_FoodItem> wheat <END> . Loved how  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  used crumbled  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  instead of  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  strips. Every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  had the right amount of  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>  can make just about any  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  better. The balance between the  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> mayonnaise <END>  was just right which really put this  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  over the top for me. <START:Service> service <END>  with a smile and no  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> lines <END>  during this visit. Hope  <START:Food> it <END>  stays  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  way. Earl of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , conquering Caesars Palace.
